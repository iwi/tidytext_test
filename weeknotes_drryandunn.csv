"I read a few blog-posts this week includingI mentioned last week that I think our work family is brilliant and I love working with them. They have — individually and collectively—a fantastic approach to problem solving which is essential in the context of our role. They display many of the characteristics outline in the above.This week has called upon our positivity, strength in adversity, pragmatism and tenacity in spades.I’ve thought a lot about data science in the context of digital services this week.This weeks gifs are all Kimmy Schmidt — inspired by Sam.I caught up with Alaine first thing. She doesn’t work Fridays so a quick informal round up on Monday morning covers off any important stuff. We talked about the HM Treasury Churchill feedback session and Google analytics.I mentioned last week that we were hosting the community of interest and I’d (admittedly quite late in the day) opened up the morning to anyone who wanted to drop in. Nikki from NHS Information Services had taken up the offer and we wandered over to the Business Events Centre — a fancy venue on site.Stephen set up and tested the tech for the afternoon — which was an iterative process! Nikki found out about our work in a series of one to one sessions — in amongst this I picked up some individual conversations with the team. Nikki then presented some of what her team does — always good to hear about the commonalities and differences in terms of organisational set ups, approaches and challenges. with individuals in the team.The afternoon session was streamed across four locations with a presentation from each site. Jane did a great job organising and co-ordinating with Dawn and Owen and it was reassuring to see the community venturing out of London.Newport (Office for National Statistics Data Science Campus)Kirsty, a Senior Policy Manager from the Economic and Social Research Council gave an introduction about the ESRC then Pete and Matt from the University of Cardiff spoke in more detail about their work analysing social media.Titchfield (Office for National Statistics) Nigel from the ONS Big Data team talked through the web scraping guidance they’ve developed.Newcastle (Department for Work Pensions) Stephen and I talked about lessons learned in respect to scaling using the cloud and embedding data science into business as usual.London (Government Digital Service) Mat from GDS spoke about Blockbuster which is a prediction model related to school estates maintenance.In my session I was probably more provocative than this particular audience needed — indicated by stunned silence.Even on reflection I feel it was important to raise the points I did. Essentially these wereThis wasn’t a whole hearted condemnation and I hope it didn’t come across as such. Stephen’s bit was less controversial.After the session a few of the attendees from different organisations wanted to chat — I had another meeting to attend. I had hoped to use the morning open session for North/North East relationship building. It was great that Nikki joined us but some people were unable to attend so I covered what I could ahead of my other meeting but had to cut things short which was bit of shame. There will be more conversations and offers of support.I had to head back for a few pressing conversations about Manhattan — primarily a progress update on the resolution(s) around data quality, movement, protection and security which I mentioned last week. Two people critical to the solution(s) started leave on the coming Friday and we had to get everything lined up. Given the large number of moving parts involved it was inevitable there would be some more complications — there were.It was my son’s first full day at his new secondary school — I dropped him off and headed into central Newcastle for a coffee with our new G7 data scientist. There are still a few HR checks to complete before they can start but I wanted to meet them face to face as I was on leave for the interview. It was a positive meeting.I then called Kieran, a London-based fast-streamer who’d been allocated to my team. He was hoping not to have to relocate to Newcastle and given the six month nature of the role I suggested to Charlie that we create a London based cross-data science role. This effectively meant me giving up some resource for my own team but benefitting data science for the department — and also Kieran. I missed the directorate G6 call because of the two staffing things.A large part of Tuesday was emails (normally Wednesday’s job but I was travelling on Wednesday this week). There were actions to take on desk moves, planning, data visualisation training, some meetings to arrange, bits and bobs from the community of interest meeting and some other things that had been in my inbox for a while which I wanted to tie together and needed some thinking time.I read Philippa’s blogpost with interest. This showed a similar approach to our hub — applying agile principles to suit projects — and had some good ideas on the discovery phase for data science projects. A good example of considering data science in the context of digital services, Philippa is doing a great job.I met with Gayll. We talked about a few things. In particular — deciding whether to pull out of our agenda item at a senior leaders meeting Gayll had been invited to — they didn’t have any suitable tech. On one hand it wouldn’t look great pulling out of the meeting late in the day but on the other we couldn’t do the product justice in those circumstances — we decided to pull out. We also talked about some staffing stuff, development, relationship management and how to tailor some of those things.I had a chat with statistical services colleagues about pipelines. In particular how Matt’s reproducible pipeline work might dovetail or otherwise with our own developments. More to come on this.Stephen, Daniel, Becky and I then spoke about environments. This was in relation to a potential new solution to our Manhattan alpha challenge and stemmed from their meeting with Ash’s team. It also provided benefits for Greyhound alpha.On the way to pick my son up I phoned Charlie about one thing and we ended up speaking about a few others.Working from home-ish then travelling to London. I fired a couple of emails to Stephen with things to read. Alaine and I exchanged emails about performance data, indicators and dashboards.I joined the cross hub information session followed by the prioritisation call — which I was a little late for. I responded to some emails. Churchill ones from Stuart about user research, feedback and interaction — I included my early thoughts on behavioural science and internal users. I introduced Philippa to Alaine on the back of her blogpost.I called Becky and Stephen separately about related things — largely getting an update on Manhattan which still needed a couple of things confirmed. Then I got my stuff ready for London and headed off to meet Stuart for the train.On the way to London I prepared what I was going to say the following day at the conference. Stuart and I talked about Churchill comms.Later on I showed Stuart Audree’s version of the Cassie inspired user manual for me — and made the decision to encourage our team members to complete their own.Presenting at the data for policy 2017 conference. An international conference series exploring the interface between data science and government policy. I had been invited to present as part of the Government Digital Service session — Building self-service data science tools for policymakers.I found the room and checked my laptop connected and displayed correctly — which it did, first time, with no issues, result!Philippa arrived to do the same and was also successful. We caught up and chatted about roadmaps. Dawn, who was chairing the session, joined us and then Kate arrived after a bit of a nightmare journey.I was speaking about and showing Churchill — and a little bit about Greyhound — with Kate providing a user’s perspective. We were sandwiched between Philippa talking on data literacy and Nicky talking on some of the GDS data science projects.The whole session felt like it went well and there was a lot of interest afterwards. I couldn’t stick around for the rest of the event unfortunately as I had to be back in Newcastle — emails on the train back.I emailed the team about the user manual for me and completed some admin.I had a chat with Adam about data visualisation training. The data vis group had met yesterday but wanted some input from me on a particular section. I agreed I would look at it that afternoon.I met with Gayll, Joana and Becky about Long Island — this was a discussion ahead of our meeting with Pauline, head of labour market policy and employer/demand strategy. The session was along the lines of the auditing the data sources and exploring possible methodologies steps (for the problem we’re trying to solve) outlined in Philippa’s blogpost above. We have some potentially very powerful data at our disposal for this work with lots of data science possibilities. There is a lot of enthusiasm about it and we agreed where we thought it was best to focus initially in the context of the user needs.We then called Pauline. Effectively this was to discuss, refine and agree some of the other steps — constraints, (information) needs, who else has looked at the problem and how to proceed. Pauline was equally enthusiastic and we agreed an approach. I then reconvened with Gayll, Joana, Becky plus Daniel to refine. This is an exciting and important piece of (discovery) work.I looked at the data visualisation training and made a decision on the section in question and then met with statistical services colleagues about GDS registers where Daniel is supporting some work.Charlie was in Newcastle so we got in a face to face meeting — I updated him about the Manhattan alpha progress — explaining the context of our different environments. We also spoke more conceptually about policy and strategy and culture change.I caught up with Stephen following his meeting with an ONS colleague about environments — this came from the community of interest — they were interested in finding out more about our set up and continued engagement.Finally Becky, Stephen and I met with Kevin late in the day to finalise the solutions for Manhattan (and Long Island) before Kevin went on leave — Kevin and Neil went above and beyond this week to get everything lined up so a massive thanks to them.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","There were two reasons for me starting to write #weeknotes.The main one – let’s say 80% – was to keep my team and anyone else who might be interested, updated on what I’ve been up to. I can flit around quite a bit, both geographically and mentally.The second – 20% – was to use it as a potential gateway into ‘proper blogging’. Anyone who has read my #weeknotes will probably thinks this sounds a little paradoxical given how much I hate writing. The hatred is mainly to do with my (in)ability to get what is in my head out.This week I have added a mini blogpost at the end of the episode. This hopefully ties together themes that have cropped up over the past few weeks.No theme for this weeks gifs.I had a quick chat with Stuart when I arrived in the office. He asked if I had time to discuss some design ideas for Churchill. After a few good mornings and quick conversations we headed to the atrium – with coffee.The current sprint/release was bringing the ability for users to explore in Churchill by Parliamentary Constituency. This in turn necessitated the ability to choose different geography types. Which meant some reasonably significant changes to the application. We discussed future iterations.Back at desks, Daniel arrived with his manual of him – which was very good and very Daniel.I spent some time structuring my thoughts on lessons learned from getting Churchill to private beta. I had to talk – along with Ash – about these the next day at a Directorate senior leadership team planning day. Alaine had documented and themed them so it was a case of framing the top level picture for that forum.I dialled into the regular call with the digital engagement team – about external comms. I took an action to speak about internal communications with Joanne R who would be at OneTeamGov North so I arranged to chat there – if we could. I also arranged to meet Zoe there to talk about product and data.After the call I headed downstairs to briefly speak with Ash about lessons learned. Becky and I then worked through an update about Manhattan alpha for a telephone meeting later that afternoon.I left the office and headed to a very lovely coffee shop near my son’s new school. The timing meant if I’d stayed in the office for the Manhattan meeting I would’ve been late to collect him (and walk the route from his school to my wife’s work with him – secondary school seems to bring with it stark changes in independence levels) plus I love working in coffee shopsEn route I called Gayll to see how her meeting had gone with Kayleigh, a social researcher in the behavioural science space. I covered off a few emails and then dialled into the Manhattan call with Lee and Steve from the Employer Engagement plus Becky, Charlie and I where we coveredAfter the call I caught up with Charlie briefly about the lessons learned session.Directorate 5 year plan – day 1.I seem to have talked an inordinate amount about plans recently, there has been a lot of asks for various flavours of plan. I fall into the Dwight D. Eisenhower camp, thinking thatThis affects my enthusiasm towards plans. I do however see the value of an outcome focused roadmap which was the aim of the game for these two days.Before I headed across to the other building I got the news that our new G7 data scientist had passed through all the required checks and processes and we now have a start date.Into the planning. The morning session was scene setting by Paul, our Director, followed by Marie C and Emily F – from our central analysis division – running through the landscape for our Department and potential challenges over the next five years. Ash and I delivered our lessons learned.I updated that we’d expanded the private beta to include some more organisations and more data.The afternoon was post it note planning on outcomes and the necessary outputs to support them. The day went on until 7pm, I had to leave earlier than that.Directorate 5 year plan – day 2.Oversimplifying but the morning was about milestones and priorities the afternoon about teams. Alyson – as usual – made insightful and succinct points about user focus and multi-disciplinary teams. It was good to hear someone else flying these digital flags in the data world.Sometimes I feel there is a lot of bluster, some might say lip-service, or perhaps it’s just misunderstanding about applying emerging digital ways of working in data.During the day – I was reminded of the parable of the blind men and the elephant. You’ve probably heard the story.Those versions, which illustrate the need for communication, and respect for different perspectives are my favourite versions of the story.Paul spoke well about building parts of a whole.Outside of the planning, at lunch I made a call to Stuart to ask him to set up a meeting about a project — outside of our team — that is closing down. I also called Becky to get an update on data and security for Manhattan.After the planning meeting I went via my desk to chat to Stephen. Paul G had mentioned a training opportunity which was relevant to him. Also David B and I had chatted about the people we’ve been engaging with about architecture.I asked Stephen to hook up with David for a proper conversation.OneTeamGov North day in Leeds.Emails on the train then I dialled into the data science hub prioritisation meeting – dodgy signal and noise made this a bit awkward.I called Stuart from the pleasant surroundings outside of LeedsOne to chat to him about data for Churchill following Marie’s session and various other conversations.I met Debbie and Maxine (I think you should follow them on Twitter), grabbed a coffee made a couple of quick phone calls and then was into the day.Introductions and initial thoughts on the northern-aspect of things. A lot of agreement on the importance of doing rather than talking I added my view and a preference for a local and community focus.James J reflected on the OneTeamGov event in London. The need for more representation from policy, local government and third sector.James referenced Matt’s blogpost about the event and spoke about contempt culture and also introversion.I added my thoughts on how OneTeamGov started to knock down some of the false boundaries that exist around the place and highlighted the similar challenges we should be tackling together.The day was about moulding the northern branch OneTeamGov. Some of this was practicalities and some of it teasing through early principles and concepts to answer the questionIt was a well organised day and I’m looking forward to seeing how things evolve.On the edges of the meeting James and I had a positive conversation about how – from a day job perspective – we can better link up. I met with Zoe afterwards to discuss data, products and teams. Zoe was a good listener. I’ve spoken about data product owners on Twitter a few times, including with Zoe – it always sparks interest. I’ve just about got my head around it for now.At a high level this discussion is about data and digital coming closer together. I suggest the following distinction.I also spoke to Zoe about product teams for digital data products and gaining access to the right digital professions.I called Becky on the walk back to the station for an update on the Manhattan. Unfortunately there were a couple of minor issues. Becky is very soon to go on maternity leave and we’ve both set our hearts on the project getting to a certain place — for her — before she goes. She’s put in an incredible amount of effort solving very complex challenges.I then joined a call about a DWP Digital hack day which potentially may involve Churchill. Amazingly my signal and battery allowed me to be involved in the whole call!A call with Mark from Marie’s team following up on the session at the planning day and talking about data. Co-incidentally on Thursday James had suggested I speak to Mark so I covered some of that off too and we agreed to keep in touch more regularly.I caught up with Stuart about a few things and then headed into a meeting I’d called on design patterns for digital data products. I will talk about this more another time but this first meeting was to bring people together. More needs to happen but this was the start.I had a chat with Stuart G as part of analytical community chat which is an initiative to get people to talk to each other from different areas. You volunteer and are paired at random. Stuart is my old boss, he’s brilliant, it was good to chat to him.Then I joined — slightly late — the regular Charlie Lync session. Mainly focussing on Manhattan.I looked through Stephen, Dave and Michael’s manuals of them — only male responses so far — not sure if thats relevant to anything.That was my week.Oh, I promised a blogpost within a blogpost, here goes… inception style.Well this is new.A brief spin off covering some of my thoughts on a couple of ‘challenge sets’ I am faced while with looking after a team building digital data products. I’ve talked about these things in a rather piece-meal way in the main #weeknotes it seemed sensible to bring it together.Broadly speaking the challenges can be represented by my scribble below.The left hand side of the sketch above (top to bottom arrow) represents the ‘traditional’ Government Digital Service journey through the phases of an agile digital projectAs you move through the phases the team needs access to different digital professions and skill sets. See here for more detail.For a number of reasons I have faced a few challenges related to accessing the skills needed at each stage. This has mainly been a symptom of change — I am drawn to roles which involve managing change. However I have found bringing digital working into a data environment quite frustrating at times.I have definitely felt contempt culture — which I mentioned above — from both sides of the digital and data fence. However small the dose it creates unnecessary bad feeling.My team was set up as an R&D function — and most of what we have developed has stuck. As a result we’ve pretty much crash-landed mid-way through the digital lifecycle with data products — that don’t look like data things or GDS things.This has left me feeling two things.Ways of working in the data world need to evolve and they are.Digital — in the GDS ways of working sense — must not become an echo chamber. People can — and have at times — become dangerously flippant or dismissive about other approaches or ideas that don’t robotically follow the GDS manual.As a result — and this has always been the case — rightly or wrongly — I don’t always do what I’m told to do.Back tot he sketch. The top (left to right arrow) represents the (data, data science and publishing) environment needs at each phase.In her recent blogpost, Philippa spoke about data science discoveries. In particular that data, methodologies and ethics are the new things that her team must consider for data science projects over an above a traditional discovery.In my experience — environments and architecture present the biggest challenge as you look to move beyond discovery — and even in discovery depending on what you want to achieve in that phase. This is especially true in an developing data and digital landscape.I will illustrate, for now, with my thoughts on the move from discovery to alpha — the section in the dotted line on the sketch above — where Greyhound and Manhattan — two products being developed in my team — currently sit.Let us focus on the new things Philippa described, over and above traditional discovery — data, methodologies and ethics — but in the context of environments. The challenges areThe first of these is standard, or should be. The second is a perennial challenge especially in organisations with sensitive data who want to start using new tools.Lots of organisations now have data science sandpit areas or similar where they can experiment with tools. However these usually aren’t connected to real data or secure enough to hold it. This is why you see so many ‘mock-up’ and ‘could be’ and ‘so what’ shiny things that can’t scale.To respond to this — unless we have access to a set of all purpose environments — if anyone is in this situation please come forward! — we need to compromise, especially in the short term.We need to be smart about the environments, data and tools we have access to or ask for. Examine how to adapt (suppress, aggregate, whatever) the real data enough that is can be placed in the environment where the tools can access it and it can still meet user needs in that form.Working with dummy data when building digital data products is useless for users and sets unrealistic expectations. Think more deeply about how adapt the real data to fit with the environments and still meet user needs. Then iterate.This stage involves making your prototype digital data products available to users — wherever they are — for them to test and you to iterate.In the context of environments, the challenges areThis is usually a much bigger challenge as it is effectively making the data (in the form of the product) available to users where they are. This makes data security challenges and technology requirements more complex.Then for beta we need to scale etc.I hope the simplification above is a helpful illustration of the challenges we face in moving through the agile delivery phases for digital data products.Referring back to the sketch — projects can’t move forward without the environments (or the team). This is why so many shiny things stop dead.Moving forward might mean adapting the data so it can work in an environment you already have. Which we have done for Greyhound — and are doing for Manhattan. My team have worked very closely with our data security experts and software engineers to problem solve in this space.This might mean moving environment. We’ve had to move (each of data, data science and publishing environments) a few times now— for different reasons, some driven by us some not. We have zig-zagged between different tools and environments. Stephen has done an unbelievable job on this, making us very nimble.Importantly — from the beginning — we plan to move through the GDS type lifecycle so — in the absence of a set of all purpose environments — we can anticipate our own needs.More than that — making reusable components gets the value for the individual product plus components to benefit future similar ones. In an emerging digital data product landscape — this is where the skill is — thought, pragmatism, problem solving and collaboration.(that is how you find out what the elephant looks like)Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","A short week — I had hoped to take it as leave but agreed to cover some stuff for Charlie. Also the last episode of season one of my #weeknotes. I’m still deliberating over whether to commission a second season. I’ve enjoyed doing it and think it does me good to both take the notes and then write them up but as I’ve said before — numbers and pictures are my thing, words most certainly aren’t — so I do struggle with parts of this process.I’m looking forward to catching up with the other weeknoters on my first week back after leave and I’m pretty sure that will seal me continuing with it even if I do alter the format. Last week was all about the tv/film gifs this week, music.I sent a formal offer on Monday — to a new G7 data scientist who I hope will be joining my team — I’m excited to get another piece of the jigsaw.I got a formal offer on Tuesday — for my job — although still provisional. This was a relief as much as anything. Still a few things to sort out but I can finally start to plan properly. The last few months has been full of personal uncertainty. Hopefully I’ve sheltered the team from this. I’m pleased it was sorted before my leave.I forgot to write notes on Wednesday — I’m very much wishing I had and also that I’d written this up on Wednesday — so this may be a little brief in places.and on Thursday — I did a little work — but I did chill after that.I got through a few emails before my first meeting of the day. I still have too many emails to process. This is definitely a consequence of not working from home for the past few Wednesdays. I need a way to manage this better.My first meeting was a high level planning meeting for Manhattan with Becky, Daniel, Gayll and Alaine. Actually this was about separating activity for Manhattan as a product for Employer Engagement from activity more closely related to the strategy work I talked about last week. Becky is doing a very good job in keeping things separate.The team wanted to check there was no stray information stored in my head before I went on leave — plus for me to outline my thoughts on our approach to the strategy work, of which Manhattan type stuff will form the backbone — which i did. I do love a white board. We talked briefly about applying agile practices to R&D/analysis/data science. Its a topic thats rears its head every now and again — largely when we have to balance a few things in the team and split people’s time between products/projects — we tend to operate Kanban for this stuff. We’re still learning, there is always room for improvement but when in doubt pragmatism wins. Becky has Manhattan work to manage, Daniel is also working on Mercury but the discovery activity for the strategy work is important to scope out and lay foundations for.I will arrange more formal whole hub planning and prioritisation sessions when I return from leave — we will need two or three days. I want to define a broad work plan for the medium to long term based on the three parts of the vision I mentioned last week and then to break that plan down into well defined short term tasks. Plus its important to make all the other activity that people are involved in visible. I’m looking forward to starting this process.I called Eddie — Kit had suggested we talk. Eddie is a data scientist at Ministry of Justice Digital and broadly speaking was interested in data visualisation and embedding data science.We had a good chat. I ended up covering some of the conversation I’d had with Philippa the previous week about digital and data and we spoke in a little bit of detail about the work taking place in our respective teams. I said I would share some resources and information on data visualisation. We’ll speak again and meet soon.Charlie called me — he is/was supposed to be on leave but now that all the data scientist interviews are complete — there were a few things he wanted me to sort out with regard to some of the posts and offers.Neil T (Data Services) popped to my desk. Neil wanted my perspective/views on how a few pieces of work may or may not tie together. It was a really useful chat — effectively I talked about how a particular conceptually big and complicated piece of work could be broken down, what the components might look like, which bits were actually big and complicated and at a very high level what an MVP might look like for it.I then went into another meeting with Neil, this time with with Becky, Alaine and Kevin H (who is responsible for security and operational control within Data and Analytics). This was about Manhattan and also the strategy work. Neil walked us through the work he’d been doing on updating the data for Manhattan and we talked about some specific elements of the data plus also covered two factor authentication and audit capabilities for the application amongst a few other things relating to data for the strategy work. I expected the meeting to overrun — meetings with Kev usually do as they necessarily involve addressing lots of interesting and often very nuanced detail. It did overrun and resulted in some quite exciting outcomes and some wait and sees.London. Presenting at the Government Data Science Community of Interest which had a data visualisation theme.I’d decided to travel to London early to do a little preparation for the presentation. I bumped into Michael and later on Sree (who was heading to London for her first day in her new team) at the station. Michael is a front end and user experience designer (and a new data visualisation convert). He used to work with my team and now works with Kit. We spent a lot of the journey talking about design patterns and components and how we can best work together. We spoke in detail about some specific elements of the products we are working on in this respect — more to come from this hopefully.I parked myself in a coffee shop and had high hopes of prepping the material and then clearing some of email mountain. The presentation was mainly demo-ing Churchill and Greyhound however given the audience I wanted to put a couple of slides in for background and some gifs for effect.I mentioned in episode 3 that some of the content I’d prepared for Civil Service Live rendered better in Safari than Chrome or Firefox. I was reusing some of this so decided to make HTML slides and load the whole thing up in Safari to allow me to move seamlessly between slides, demos and gifs. A foolproof plan, nothing could go wrong.When I’m presenting, especially externally, I sometimes try to open with something about the particular date I’m presenting on, linked— usually tenuously — to the theme of the presentation. I find this makes people sit up and listen a bit more than hi I’m Ryan and I etc etc. So I prepared something for that.Occasionally — although more rarely and saved for longer talks— I extend this concept to amuse myself and keep peoples’ focus. For example I gave a talk at the Royal Statistical Society North Eastern Group at Newcastle University on Gary Barlow’s 40th birthday where I incorporated 40 song titles from his back catalogue into the talk.During the prep Charlie — still supposed to be on leave — phoned me with another couple of recruitment things which needed a phone call and a few emails. By the time I’d sorted that out I didn’t have time to get my teeth into my emails. Although one I did check notified me that we now had access to some data we wanted to look at so I made a quick call in to the office.I headed to the new Government Digital HQ in Whitechapel — fancy. I had a meeting first with Philippa and Louis H (Home Office) — it was their meeting but Philippa invited me to gatecrash during our conversation last week — it was good to hear Louis’ perspective on embedding data science invisibly into products and his experiences as a product manager.Dawn arrived to check the set up for presenters and informed us it would be via Chromecast which doesn’t always play nicely with Apple products and obviously works best with Chrome. It became immediately apparent that my Safari from a MacBook set up wasn’t going to be straightforward.Philippa kicked things off and Dawn talked about the Government Data Science Partnership which covered some of the content from her recent blogpost.I was next up. I’d been chatting to the tech support folks during Dawn’s session but despite all the fiddling and emailing, my laptop wouldn’t connect. Then it did — but wasn’t quite right. The we tried an HDMI cable — same problem. While they were contemplating an agenda shuffle I moved everything to Chrome and got it working. All of this took quite a bit of time.Given the delay I blasted through the presentation to try and recover the agenda timings — I had a train to catch and wanted to see the other presenters — I suspect it seemed rushed.It was the anniversary of the launch of MTV. I had faffed around and edited an image to get what I wanted to be shown on the screen at the start which was this...My intro linked the concerns and mixed attitudes of culture change — my tenuous take on the theme of Video Killed the Radio Star, the first music video shown on the station — with the work going on in my team. I’m not sure how it went down.I did the demos etc — I didn’t feel it went very well as I was going quickly and probably forgot to mention a few things — but the feedback during chats after was positive and I got some good questions —even if I felt I waffled a bit with some of the answers.As you can probably tell, overall I’m not sure I did the myself or the work justice.During the break I had to get photographed for the GDS Digital people blog which Dan H had interviewed me for during episode 3. I felt very self conscious.The second set of sessions were fromRobin from Ministry of Justice discussing interactive geographic modelling using Javascript and D3. Robin and his team are deploying browser based maps to policy customers. Check out one of the demos here.Tomas from the Alan Turing Institute talking about his work developing tools for open data-driven storytelling. This lets users easily create analyses and visualisations that are linked to the original open data source — making the analyses more transparent, reproducible, but also easy to adapt. Some neat ideas building on the what do you think type concepts developed by the New York Times and Office for National Statistics. Check out some of his early work here.It was my first visit to one of these meet ups — I enjoyed the sessions and hope to attend more. I didn’t get the chance to speak to many people but Emma, who has recently joined DWP as a Data Scientist did introduce herself and we had a quick chat before I dashed off back north. I’ve been on a few calls with Emma so it was good to put a face to the name/voice.Both the kids were poorly so I was a slightly later into the office than I’d hoped.I caught up with Becky and Daniel about the data we’d got access to — they’d had a look — seems some really valuable possibilities — more to come on this.Next I was covering for Charlie at a Data and Analytics planning meeting — one of a series. I read through all of the emails and documents to re-familiarise myself with the details. Paul Lodge, our Director was chairing. He talked through the state of play so far and I picked up an action.I’d rearranged my regular catch up with Alaine and extended it to allow us to refine our broad communications plan for our private beta-users. Churchill will be available externally — to selected users — imminently and whilst Stuart (data product owner) and I are on leave Alaine is in the driving seat. Ideally we would have been at this stage before the end of July — and before the periods of leave — but matters outside of our control delayed this. Regardless, the team should be very proud when they reach this milestone, its been a brilliant effort.Alaine and I laid out the path with a bit of flexibility to react and some decision points etc. I do love a flip chart. After that I got through the most pressing emails but didn’t get them all processed before heading off to meet my wife and kids for a meal.I spent part of the day completing the action I’d picked up from the planning meeting and then slammed my out of office on.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","My head is quite full at the minute. I need to organise it.There is a lot going on at work, people joining and people leaving us for a while. This brings all sorts of things for me to consider. The projects are all at new phases. I’ve got a few conferences coming up where I am talking and I need to get my head around that. Plus its mid-year time which always adds more thinking — both reflective and looking ahead. All in all I feel like I need a little time to sort it all out.I didn’t write many notes this week so some of the days have less detail than normal and its a bit rushed as I wanted to get it written before Monday and I’ve had a busy weekend!This weeks gifs brought to you by varieties of George.I met with Trevor H — the chief analyst at DWP. We try and get to speak when he’s in Newcastle.We chatted about operating models, digital data products and data visualisation — the meeting ran over — Trevor was in good form. Afterwards I shared the online learning resource that Adam has been leading on with me as part of our data visualisation community work.The aim is to make people think a bit more about the communication side of data visualisation. It draws on a number of sources and examples we think are helpful. It’s a bit of an experiment. We also shared it with Eddie and Sam to get some fresh views. If you’re interested in being a guinea pig give me a shout.I was straight into a Lync meeting about Manhattan with Becky plus Lee, Steve and Paul from the employer engagement side of things. Becky walked through the application, the data, the challenges and aims of the alpha phase.Paul is going to be leading on the alpha for Lee — working with a few districts to understand how the data and the application can help and change the way employer engagement works — and to iterate the prototype.I finalised my Thursday London meetings and later in the afternoon Gayll, Alaine, Ash and Stuart met to discuss plans for the near future.I worked from home for the first part of the morning since I unexpectedly had to take my daughter to hospital – she’s ok.I had to miss one thing (a regular Long Island catch up with Labour Market colleagues) and rearrange another (a hangout with Ed as part of his work with Open Data Institute) as a result.I made a couple of phone calls to Michael and Stuart ahead of the hospital and on the way into the office had some thoughts for a blogpost about dashboards and through out a quick twitter poll for title suggestions.I have quite a few thoughts on this subject which I need to formulate and articulate better but the mini-blogpost thought-dump headlines areThat feels a little better, for now. I know not everyone agrees — which means its worth talking about.When I got into the office I had a catch up about registers with statistical services colleagues. This was ahead of my Thursday meeting Ellie – product manager for registers at GDS – and also to tie together some work in my team around potential registers.I then had a call with Rachel – DWP comms – and Anoush from apolitical about Churchill.Normally working from home day but I headed into the office as I still had no wifi . Having no wifi was self inflicted — a bit of a stand off with suppliers— the kids haven’t enjoyed it.Its sorted now though and everyone is happy.I did quite a bit of email stuff on Wednesday.I caught up with Gayll and then sat with Joana for a while to talk through the work she is leading on with Long Island – segmenting geographies based on changes in volatility of a measure over time. It’s complex and interesting. Joana talked a bit about data, techniques, communicating the findings and whats next.I spoke with Stephen about repeatable analytics pipelines.More email stuff.London.I very often hearor similar — so I decided to schedule a day of those meetings that normally fit in amongst other ones. Stephen was involved in most of them — we spoke on the train about the day ahead, with a coffee.The first meeting was with Oli – statistical researcher at the House of Commons Library. He bought me a latte – thanks Oli – and talked Stephen and I through the remit he has around considering data science in the library.We talked aboutOli had a bit of a play with Churchill.Next I caught up with Kit — we’ve been trying to get a face to face chat in for ages — it felt like a win to get our calendars aligned briefly.I had a mocha with Kit — my third variety of coffee within a short space of time. We spoke about all sorts of things, policy and service design, products, people and personalities. The conversation bounced along at pace — as it usually does — and the time went too quickly — as it usually does.Stephen and I headed to GDS via lunch and ‘London people watching’ in Pret— ahh London folk.We spoke to Ellie about registers — the origins, the ideas, the possibilities. I’m definitely going to see if/how we might be able to use registers in our products and have some specific actions.We also spoke a little about the data inclusion work at GDS. I think this is about layers of communication and it cuts interestingly across the subject of personality types.Ellie had a bit of a play with Churchill.Next up we spoke with Philippa, Nicola and Prateek from the GDS better use of data team about platforms. We were joined by Tom and briefly Dan.Stephen told the story of our environments – which is one of pragmatism, nimbleness and cutting our cloth according to deliver value within challenging constraints. Philippa and Prateek covered some of the cross cutting work that GDS are involved in. I gave my thoughts on where I think the value is across government and there were some actions for further more detailed conversations.As we headed across London for the train back north I dialled into a call about a hack day in Manchester but it was too noisy and then cut off in a tunnel!Becky’s last day before maternity leave — gutted — she’ll be a massive miss.I caught up with Stuart about a few things then phoned Joana. We spoke for a good while about a number of things.Then we all went out for a team lunch for Becky and I had an early finish and a couple of beers.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","This working week was mentally draining. This weeks gifs are Mr Robot. The two things are not necessarily related.I had hoped to build on the blogpost within a blogpost this week but that will have to wait. I have read a lot of other people’s blogposts though — I agree with KitIt took me away from Derren Brown’s Happy — which I am enjoying and would recommend even though I am only part way through.Charlie had asked for something which I needed to do first thing — I dragged Stuart with me — it was writing, Stuart inputted and listened to my frustration about writing stuff — even positive stuff!Stu and I dialled in to a call with Matt and Rob (product owners for the Office for National Statistics website).I first met Matt in episode 4 of season 1— I spoke at the government data publishers community which Nick had invited me to— see my #weeknotes and even some #daynotes for the event. On the day Matt spoke about customise my data — see his sprintnotes — so many types of #notes, I love it! Matt and I both saw Churchill as a power user of the eventual customise my data API.The call was to pick this conversation back up, manage expectations and decide on some early practical actions — it was nice to speak to Matt again and to discuss how best to proceed with him and Rob. It was also nice to discuss working across organisations – especially ONS – and it feeling easy and natural #oneteamgov.I received a few comments on my blogpost within a blogpost in my last #weeknotes. It was good to know that it (a) mades sense and (b) it helped a few people. I talked about two challengesat the right times, in each agile phase.In amongst afternoon email stuff I set up some meetings with interested parties to discuss our experiences of 2. My last meeting of the day was with Jill — a user researcher — to discuss some of 1.I met with Paula and Nigel, fellow data and analytics directorate G6s, to talk about some people work we’d been asked to do. Another attendee didn’t show and the meeting ended up being a non-starter.This gave me some time back and I got my teeth into emails and organising a couple of meetings — potentially the same meeting — involving Stephen and I heading to London to see Philippa and her better use of data team plus fellow #weeknoter and product manager for registers, Ellie.I think both Ellie and I think we should probably have spoken in person before now but haven’t really had a good enough reason — I think this happens a lot with people.I updated Stuart on the previous day’s meeting with Jill ahead of our planned catch up with Joanne (digital engagement comms genius) which ended up being put back to later in the day.I spoke with Stephen and Gayll about environments and other people’s risks and then called Charlie for our regular catch-up. We (inevitably) spoke about resourcing and future strategy — it over-ran (inevitably).I then attended a meeting about community of practice which Gayll was chairing. This is linked — with alignment to the Digital, Data and Technology (DDAT) job roles. DDAT job roles are clustered into 6 groups. One of these is data, where roles include data engineer, data scientist and performance analyst. People attended from a few different areas.At the #weeknoters meet-up which featured in the first episode of this season – and seems a very long time ago now – we talked about some of the pros and the cons of DDAT roles.I see the value in this aim. It’s early days though and there are gaps which can cause — for want of a better word — frustration.Naturally I tend to focus on the data gaps. I’ve spoken about data versions of job roles before in speaking about data product managers. Similarly, data visualisation design — a considerably skilled role which many people think is easy, the same thing happens with user research, for example — could abstractly be considered as a data version of user centred content or interaction design. But data visualisation designer isn’t there and I think it should be.Stuart and I called Joanne. Joanne talked about articulating Churchill as a digital service. Afterwards I felt the way you do when you’ve got to the top of a hill and can see the view.Before I left I spoke with Gayll, Becky and Daniel about their approach and ideas for Long Island.As I write this, I just noticed Wednesday is an ‘anagram’ of Swedenday. Anyway. Wednesday dragged me all over the place mentally.Wednesday — I’m typing Wednesday but thinking Swedensday, yes I’ve added another s — is working from home day. But my wifi was off so I worked from a local coffee shop. It was nice to have a change of scenery.I messaged Sam about something — I thought about it a lot before doing so. I also told her I was on my way to work from a coffee shop as I know she likes to do that too.Julie had tweeted about #OneTeamGov breakfast, they talked about data stuff at it. I was a bit sad about this — I was pleased that OneTeamGov were (finally) talking about data stuff — but I quite like talking about data stuff and I wasn’t there.I’ve felt — on more than a few occasions recently — that not being in London might mean I miss out on some — intangible — things. I’ve never really felt like that before. I’m not sure when or why it started — although I also often think I’m short of digital data peers to talk things over with so it might be that — I keep trying to work out what I feel about those feelings. Then I realise it doesn’t matter. Then something perfect happens, like this from Dan.I will talk to Dan about data stuff, in Newcastle.I read a massive email about the 5 year plan. Then the day all went a bit south. Stuart then texted me to forewarn me he was going to send me an email with some honest thoughts and feelings about a few things relating to the Churchill workload. I read it. It was another long email. I phoned him.Some of this was about access to the right skills. Some of it – although linked – was about regaining control of a few things. We talked for quite a while. I’ve known Stuart for a long time and I’m pleased we can be completely open and honest with each other about when things feel a bit shit.I received an email from Alaine with some other questions about general people stuff relating to vacancies. Later on in the afternoon I spoke to Gayll about the pressures — and access to the right skills and control of a few things — relating to the three products (Greyhound, Manhattan and Long Island) she is overseeing — with Joana, Becky and Daniel.I was aware of the pressures — of course I was —I speak to the team every day. I mentioned last week about how moving between agile phases for a digital data product brings pressures. Churchill has recently moved to beta, Greyhound and Manhattan are about to move to alpha and Long Island discovery has just kicked off — it’s a bit of a perfect storm.(by the way in between all this Stephen called to update me on the meeting I’d asked him to have with David B about environments, platforms and architecture stuff. This was a positive call.)I’ve been trying to prepare solutions to a lot of this pressure but — for a number of reasons —it hasn’t worked out how I would like. I reflected on where my own actions might not have helped. I did my best to help clarify a few things.People’s feelings matter and I care about my work family so it ended up feeling like a bit of a rubbish day.I grabbed a coffee with Stuart and we chatted about some Churchill design stuff.The bulk of the day was taken up by the data and analytics directorate senior leadership team meeting — all the G6 people, deputy directors and Paul, our director. Plus our commercial, HR and finance business partners — gathered together in Newcastle.We covered the 5 yr plans. Louise, our HR business partner talked through the changes to the people performance processes ahead of mid year review time and then ran a session on personality types (based on this). This was my result.Interestingly the only people to be horses were our three business partners.I mentioned in episode 3 of the first season that personality tests are a guilty pleasure. I’ve read quite a bit about the subject, its history and the analytical shortcomings — but I love them and I think they are a really good thing to do with a team.I chatted with Lou about these sort of things and sent her this test that I’ve done with our team in which I was also owly, a barn owl —always INTJ. I also sent Audree’s manual of me and Philippa’s blogpost.During lunch Paul asked me about my OneTeamGov lanyard and we got chatting about a few ideas in Newcastle.The afternoon sessions were about high level comms, changes to commercial governance — similar to the people performance processes the changes are designed to make things more pragmatic and visible. Then a stand up — Paul and the team chatting to the directorate in the office space ahead of the final part of the meeting any other business which was quite busy.After the meeting I caught up with the team about Long Island and Manhattan data. I then introduced Stephen to Matt C — our new head of architecture within data and analytics. I covered what we’ve been up to in the hub in terms of environments — some of which I alluded to last week — and how I’ve aligned it to the wider strategy and architecture. Stephen and Matt will talk again in more detail.First thing was a session with Michael and Stuart about data visualisation and user experience. I had a few important — albeit low wattage — lightbulb moments. I can’t quite articulate these right now but I suspect I’ll talk about them sometime.I got back to my desk late and ended up missing the Long Island meeting with Pauline which I felt bad about. I apologised to Gayll, Becky and Joana.People’s which animal are you ?— I had of course shared it — were coming back. Joana — MonkeyLion— and I chatted. I’m very conscious that because of where we sit and how we work that Joana is probably the person in the team I interact with least. We spoke about this a little bit. I’d noticed she had been a little quiet recently — she had been in the zone working to complete cluster work for Long Island.We caught up about her visit to Sheffield the previous day to talk about her work on local level predictive models for Greyhound.I had a few chats about various people about various product things around the desks. Then joined the regular Lync session with Charlie. I left this a little early to meet my son from school but phoned Becky to catch up afterwards.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","I wrote hardly any notes this week— somewhat in an attempt to make the process of writing these notes quicker — I’m not sure it did. I definitely have a love hate relationship with writing — mainly hate to be honest.By way of contrast, this weeks gifs are flavours of happy — I’ve started reading Derren Brown’s book of the same name — exploring concepts of happiness.There is a short section at the end that contains something thats been on my mind this week, I’d welcome your thoughts.Bank Holiday — I genuinely can’t remember what I did but I wasn’t at work.My notes for Tuesday simply saidIt started ok — I caught up with Alaine first thing. We had a hub meeting scheduled and I wanted to hijack it to tie together people’s thoughts on a pile of planning asks. I then had a bit of time to blitz emails before heading into the meeting.I had to head out of work for an hour or so to drop my son at a thing. This meant I basically set the scene in the meeting and left — I felt bad about this and it disrupted my day somewhat but it was unavoidable.Now thatChurchill has moved into private beta — a proper thing out there scaling on the internet— how the beta phase worksGreyhound and Manhattan are approaching alpha — testing prototypes with users, finding and fixing problems, estimating costs and risks — how the alpha phase workswe have some decisions to make about resource and priorities across the hub. This meeting was a bit about that.I caught up with Alaine as I headed back and got some feedback from the meeting.One thing that has been evident from the outset of running the hub is that we are working on the edge of processes. In some cases this is because the processes are still being developed and in others its because what we need to do is non-standard. Both of these are beginning to conflate and become blockers upon blockers. But along the way we are delivering capability for others — which although its definitely the right thing to do, it can be quite intangible to some people.On top of this there are wider pressures to quantify the value of our products to the business. Given the nature of them, this is both frustrating and challenging.I joined the monthly cross hub call — and felt that I was quite downbeat and perhaps negative — although apparently I came across as realistic.I had the commute home from hell. I turned up the music loud. Stupid Tuesday.I didn’t write any notes for Wednesday.In the morning I worked on structuring my thoughts the planning asks plus emails about the Government Data Science Community meet up — Stephen and Alaine have been really helpful with this. I had a chat about some desk move stuff.I had to head out to drop my son at day two of the thing and got a good call in with Stuart about value — quantifying the savings of having far more efficient access to data — speeding up the investigative and iterative processes involved in policy, design, evaluation and briefing.I bought some biscuits for the team on the way back and had a chat with Iu who was in Newcastle for our meeting.Gayll, Iu and I met with Jack a PhD student specialising in cryptography and homomorphic encryption for cloud computing. It was our first meeting with Jack, a bit of a white-boarding meeting to discuss our ideas, which moved us forward slightly. Thinking about some of this stuff hurts my head.I worked on emails later in the day to make up for the time out of the office earlier — I feel like I get more emails than I ever have in this job, enquiries about data visualisation, sifting panels, presenting at something, advice on something — so I dealt with a few of those. I got a meeting organised to discuss design patterns and put my thoughts together on resourcing for Charlie.I finally got round to emailing Zoe to try and arrange a chat about product. Although we haven’t been able to pin down a time yet I’m excited to talk to her.I didn’t write any notes for Thursday either.On the commute I arranged to meet our new G7 data scientist for a coffee next week. I’m looking forward to meeting them.I had a lot of meetings on Thursday. I had a call with Charlie to sort some stuff out to do with my pay and then a chat with Gayll about something I’d forgotten to send out before I went on leave. Gayll helpfully tied the comms together with something she was doing anyway.I met Adam to talk about the data visualisation training we’ve been working on — Adam has been doing all the work. He covered the design pattern stuff and blogging amongst other things. It’d been a little while since we’d caught up so was good to talk and agree some actions.I was straight into a call with Kate from HM Treasury and Stuart about the Data for Policy Conference. I’ve been asked to talk about Churchill and to ‘bring along a policy maker’ to talk about their thoughts. The plan is background — demo — Kate’s thoughts.Kate gave some initial feedback on the application which was really useful — she was really positive about the Agile working and our ability to react and respond to user needs and gave some thoughts on additions. I left the call pretty content.Then it was into a Lync session with folks from the analytical community reciprocating their session last week and hopefully building some collaboration — otherwise there is a risk of some duplication.I spent the afternoon in a room with Alaine on lessons learned and planning which Charlie has asked for. I really struggle with planning — especially in an environment of R&D and innovation — I understand the need but in practice things change too quickly so plans end up so high level you wonder where the value is. It was a bit of a merry go round as I brought different people into the room to discuss aspects of their products — I didn’t make as much progress as I’d have liked but the session was helpful to draw out some significant challenges.I did make some notes.I tied up quite a few loose end emails including one to the Newcastle Analyst Group about an opportunity for Professor David Sumpter to come and talk to us about his book Soccermatics.As I was getting through emails the team were discussing at desk some of the challenges I mentioned earlier. They really are a brilliant group. I am always impressed by their ability to work together to solve complex problems in a logical and thoughtful way — and to embrace the process. I’m incredibly proud of the team.The Churchill team dialled into the first feedback session with HM Treasury. This was exciting since most DWP users have grown with the application whereas HMT colleagues were flying solo.We got some really helpful feedback on the design, performance and some detailed asks for future features. But here is a high level summaryI had quick exchanges with Stu and Ash afterwards and they were both pleased with the level of engagement and feedback.Then it was into a meeting with Kevin, Neil and Becky about Manhattan. To cut a long story short this was going through various permutations to ensure we balance utility of data with data quality, protection and security. We got to a resolution we think can workStephen then joined us to talk about some data movement challenges and we got to a resolution to that too we think. Kev was really helpful — Monday and Tuesday will be important days.Final meeting of the day was the regular show and tell with Charlie — explaining the challenges and proposed resolutions — and some of the responsibilities for Charlie — for Manhattan. The progress made by Joana, Daniel and Gayll on Greyhound — including some positive collaboration with the analytical community. Gayll talked about plans for Long Island and there was an update on Mercury — a side project Daniel and Stephen have been working on which lead to some discussion about environments and tooling other stuff with Charlie.I caught up with Charlie on the phone in the evening and a little bit on Saturday to discuss planning and comms.That was my week.Thought for the week.I’ve thought a lot about altruism this week.Consider this situation if you will.Now consider this.I’d welcome your thoughts.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","The first episode of season two, I’m back from leave, feeling refreshed and ready to go.I decided to continue with #weeknotes as — despite the pain of writing — the good outweighs the bad. I also think its important for data people to try and talk more in a non-data environment.I do need to adapt and evolve many aspects of the process and format. I’m going to be stricter with myself more generally — many people pointed out to me that I couldn’t continue at the pace I was before I was confirmed in the role — I was starting to break so I have some new rules.Overall this was a week of catching up and confirming or re-formulating the emerging plans that are in my head.This weeks gifs come courtesy of Tom Cruise. There are too many of them.I blitzed loads of emails on my commute — my thinking about having a work mobile is shifting — having resisted getting one for a long, long time, I’m making it work for me far more now I have one, especially in terms of clearing and responding to emails.When I got into the office I chatted with Stuart and Alaine. While I had been on leave Churchill moved into private beta — which for those unfamiliar with how government teams launch digital services is a public pre-release that isn’t open to everyone. In our case we’d made Churchill available to a few handpicked organisationsThe release had been delayed slightly as Stuart had to clarify some legal stuff.However everything went really smoothly in terms of technically making the application available to the outside world.This is a big milestone for the team. Churchill is the first service of its kind meaning they’ve had to contend with lots of challenges and shifting sands. They’ve approached it all with professionalism, tenacity and good humour. I’m really proud of everyone involved and immediate feedback was reassuringly positive.I had a quick chat with Stephen who was back from three weeks in Florida then had a walking meeting with Stuart before catching up with Joana, Daniel and Becky at desk. Loads to update me on, lots of which was to do with data. Data for Long Island — which the strategy work I mentioned towards the end of season one is now known as — data for Manhattan — the employer engagement application— plus some other very useful data which Daniel secured. Becky and I also discussed some stakeholder challenges. which we’ll need to address.I headed out with most of the team for a Churchill celebration pub lunch. It was a good opportunity to catch up. I was back in the office in time for a Lync session about a tool being developed within our analytical community looking at Labour Market information — big potential for collaboration here, despite some concerns about poor internal comms since each area should have known about each other’s work before now.I then had a call with Charlie. This was mainly a catch up but as usual we touched upon future direction and I picked up a few actions. Charlie is currently covering for Paul (Director of Data and Analytics) whilst he is on leave so is being dragged in a few directions.More clearing of emails on the commute. Tuesday became a day of post-leave email stuff. I contacted our new G7 data scientist who is currently in the midst of processes — hopefully not too long — I arranged to meet for a coffee when they return from leave.Lots of Data Science Hub stuff related to GDS with emails and comms relating toOn Tuesday GDS had also tweeted our Churchill blogpost from February. This seemed a bit randomHowever it prompted a few things including a request for an interview and interest from other Departments and organisations in using Churchill.I had a call about a potential hack event which also included some talk about OneTeamGov North that Shelley, Debbie and others are working on and which I’m keen to be involved in.I finally got an email out to a few people about data search — hopefully more to come on this.London. I got the train with Stephen which was a bit of a last minute thing. We had a good catch up on the journey. We’d both just returned from a period of leave so chatted about our time off and how we were both keen to get back into things now. We talked about Amazon Web Services, Woodstock — our emerging platform — and future plans.We met Iu at Caxton House and spent the morning talking about a variety of things including internal politics and the Government Data Science community meet up. When I was first asked to be involved in the four site event by Jane I suggested a broad theme for the day ofI chose this since I firmly believe that activity in government data science should be aimed towards developing capability and reusable products which lead to improved outcomes for people and society — rather than whizzy shiny things, novelty analysis, vanity projects and raising personal profiles. I think we need to keep the conversation on the right path.I was asked to talk on a topic so I suggested — scaling using the cloud. I’d then went on leave and forgot about it. Now I have to make sense of it. I always find it takes longer and more effort to prepare for a shorter presentation.Stephen, Iu and I got some broad ideas in place and talked about community and capability building more generally.Stephen and I then went our separate ways. I spent the afternoon on emails and admin. I spoke to Donna about some resourcing things, called Dan H to discuss the details for Thursday’s photoshoot and then passed on the news to the team – they’re getting used to emails starting — SURPRISE!I spoke to Stu about some planning stuff for Max and managed brief chats with Charlie and Chris.I had a few missed calls from Kit so called her back as I was leaving the building. We had a good chat covering my current thoughts and ideas, high level concepts and closer working plus some altruistic OneTeamGov type thoughts. We agreed to meet up soon to try and shake some of the ideas out of my head and join our thoughts up. It was nice to catch up.I was then a little behind schedule – as always tends to be the case – I had a brisk walk to Millbank for our weeknoters meet-up in a Harry Potter style room with lovely people. I was really looking forward to this but I wasn’t sure why.It was great meeting everyone in real life — it seemed that others in the group knew each other to various degrees — Matt knew everyone — but this was the first time I had met any of them in person. Although as Sam and Matt have pointed out, it kind of felt like I knew them which made it easier — especially for a wallflower like me.There was no set agenda and it could’ve been really awkard but Ben, Sam, Louise, Dan, Matt, Jonathan and Julie — others unfortunately couldn’t make it — made it an enjoyable experience talking about our thoughts, motivations and approaches for our #weeknotes.Some people take 30 mins, some take hours, some got into it for visibility, some to cure writers block, some are still trying it to see it if sticks, some have committed to it for a year. But everyone was pretty much as I’d imagined, primarily thoughtful — which I guess comes with the territory but and also genuine and just nice people.I think everyone really cares about what they do and I sense we have all learned a bit about ourselves from the process.Matt is very insightful and knowledgeable — he made me think about writing as a skill to be practiced, he also referred to us as a group of bloggers, I hadn’t considered myself a blogger. Thanks to him we all have #weeknotes and soon a new publishing domain. Thanks Matt.Overall Wednesday was a very long but enjoyable day. I was disappointed not to be able to join the group for drinks but I had completely lost track of time and I had to hotfoot it — to put it mildly — across London to catch my train back.(I accept that a Top Gun ‘need for speed’ gif may have been the obvious choice here but believe me this one is more representative)I feel that there could be a lot more to come from this talented group and I’d really like to meet up again and be involved with whatever inevitably transpires. I’m also looking forward catching up with Dan about some of the search work.I spoke with Stuart first thing about a variety of Churchill stuff and then with Becky about Manhattan and Long Island.Its really difficult to undersell the complexity of the challenges that Becky is facing and managing. Its a real balance and we need to make this visible to stakeholders more to manage their expectations.I got grief from Daniel (Sunderland fan), Becky (Nottingham Forest fan) and Joana (just joining in!) about the previous night’s Newcastle United match.I headed for a meeting with Ash who leads our partner team of software and data engineers. This was an initial chat about next steps and direction for Churchill but also covered some other aspects.We’ll have another meeting or two with others on the detail but broadly speaking we can now focus on bringing Greyhound and the interactive statistics dashboards – produced by our Statistical Services colleagues – “into” Churchill.Greyhound – currently an advanced prototype – will bring embedded analytics – in simple terms allowing users to very quickly identify high rates of change in certain metrics. The work will also open up more data to Greyhound users.Bringing the interactive dashboards — such as the Personal Independence Payment and Universal Credit ones — will bring efficiencies and improvements for users. Linked to this, Ash and I also talked about design patterns – general repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.GDS have some excellent design patterns for customer facing transactional services but the current service design manual doesn’t yet cater for design of data (visualisation) applications like ours.I have had intermittent conversations with Sam R at GDS about developing consistent design patterns for these purposes. In the mean time we will get our DWP house in order by working across our various data (visualisation) applications, including those from our hub, those from the stats world and those from Kit’s team to maintain consistency among our emerging designs.Stu and I had a walking meeting to talk about some of these plans and then joined Ash on a call with Charlie to cover high level lessons learned about the move to private beta and some time and resource plans.Then Stephen, Becky, Joana, Daniel and I made the short journey to Tyneview Park for our surprise photoshoot. Paul C signed us in and looked after us until it was time for the photos. It was great chatting to Paul and hearing about his work.Zara and her team were at Tyneview Park filming some of Paul’s colleagues. Dan H had also only let Zara know late in the day about photographing us so neither side really knew much about what was needed. In the end it was a fun session with a quite surreal — yet somewhat representative — mix of work and play.I’m looking forward to seeing the photos.A short day. I forgot to make any notes as I thought I would remember when I wrote it up — I totally didn’t.I had a call with Charlie in the morning to discuss some details of my new role.I then had a series of chats, phone calls and emails and left work at noon!That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","The theme of this week is most definitely collaboration. Continuing it, valuing it, respecting it and instigating it. Vive la collaboration!Late back from Center Parcs but caught up with Charlie about the interviews I’d missed in Newcastle. Can’t say much more yet.I checked emails on the metro into work until I got stuck in a tunnel. I was supposed to join a meeting with Charlie and didn’t get out until after the call had finished so sent him a message to apologise. Charlie updated me on the meeting I missed. A positive and potentially exciting outcome.When I got in the office I caught up with Alaine (Delivery Lead) who was back from a couple of weeks leave. We walked across to join the Churchill mid-sprint review meeting — which included biscuits — with Ben, George, Alastair, Massimo, Ash (Developers) and Dave D (Business Analyst)We covered some high level themes and the importance ofWe discussed themed sprints, scheduled releases and reviewed the Jira board for this sprint, a few things blocked (really bottle necked) in QA.We agreed that the next sprint would be a slack sprint for the developers to cover some elements of technical debt and allow us to take stock and fully detail upcoming designs and review and add to the current backlog.We also had a quick chat about ideas for potential hack events and Ash gave an update about the production environment for private beta (looking good) and the IT health check (some money needed).When I got back to my desk I had a chat with Gayll and Joana (Data Scientists) to sort some travel and agenda details for Friday for our meeting with the Data Science team at HMRC. Dennis (Programme Team) popped over to ask if I could interview in Sheffield on Thursday as Billy (Sheffield Hub lead) had covered the first set of Newcastle ones on Monday.I caught up with Ash briefly about the mid-sprint review, he gave good feedback about how it had gone. I then headed off early for my daughter’s end of term assembly. On the journey back I got an email from Max so gave her a quick call just as she was heading into the main meeting to discuss all the 17/18 planning that had been taking place.I caught up with Charlie later on to see how that meeting had gone. It was an important one, the outcome was — more challenges than opportunities — the need to put our thinking caps on.Normally this is working from home day so I can do the school run but since my wife is a teacher who has now broken up, for the next eight weeks I will be in the office. It remains however a day to deal with emails. One discussion that came up was about the name Churchill and whether when we make the application public we will run into any problems. Billy said he was happy to cover the Sheffield interviews — so I didn’t have to travel — Billy is also covering interviews the following Monday (Sheffield) and Thursday (Newcastle) as I already had leave booked in. I owe him one. Throughout the day I was exchanging messages with Charlie about my reflections, thoughts and ideas.I chatted with Stephen, he’d just returned from delivering a hybrid version of the data vis training with Adam that Catherine had set up.Our data visualisation community — Adam is leading on this with Paul — are in the process of revamping the training to make it a self-lead web version. This was an opportunity to test some of the examples out — good feedback — people love examples to aid learning.I joined the weekly Data Science Function prioritisation meeting. Charlie talked about priorities for the next quarter and each hub plus the programme team gave updates.I had a few chats with Dave D. He showed me the latest additions to Churchill on the QA server — we’re iterating to a really good place — and we spoke about testing resource.I got some paper and started to sketch out the ‘picture on the jigsaw box’ — I’m conscious that sometimes I am the only one with this picture. More on this in a later episode probably.Adam popped up and we spoke about the training. I’ve got to send him some links. We had a good chat about community working and the benefits of a collaborative attitude over, erm, other behaviours.I headed to my son’s leavers assembly.I asked Dan some questions about his work. I’d like a proper chat with him, both about work and just generally.The end of the day was more sifting. I am now pretty confident of the broad segmentation I have formed in my head of types of data scientist applicants.I arrived in the office slightly late for my regular meeting with Alaine, we both grabbed a coffee and headed to the atrium.We had a bit to catch up on after Alaine’s leave and since her return she had been focusing on the detail and money needed for the IT health check. We caught up about that, resourcing, some important upcoming cross government and ministerial meetings/presentations and discussed the need for (me to do) some longer term planning — jigsaw box picture stuff. There is a reason why I haven’t yet which I’ll perhaps discuss in a later episode.Stuart wandered past on his way into the office and joined us. It was his first day back after a week in the sun — Alaine and I brought him up to speed with the actions/outcomes from the mid sprint review, the naming discussion and the latest additions to the app.I caught up with Stu on a walk to the cash point and then headed to the Action Learning Sets meetingI really like our little group; Fiona, Ann, Matt, Catherine and the newest recruit Donna. I can’t talk about these meetings but what I will say is I was sceptical about the concept but I’ve changed my mind.After this I finally logged on. I joined an all staff call lead by Mayank (DG for Digital). Stuart then showed me some of the new data items in QA on Churchill which look cool. I then got a cold call from a supplier.Before I left I had a chat about my thoughts on open data possibilities on the back of Nick’s Government Data Publishers meeting.I headed to my son’s cricket training and on the way spoke to Charlie about some upcoming presentations where I need to be on point.Later on I pulled together a — too big — set of links for Adam, a collation of blogs, presentations, tools, thought pieces, some of which will make it onto the resources section of the training site.London. With Joana, Gayll and Iu. Visiting Adrian, Edward, Martin, Gavin, Mike and Ben who are working on HMRC data science exploration, data exploitation and related projects.On the train down I reviewed some of my recent notes/scrawls to see what needed to be kept — I am constantly writing, rewriting and reformulating notes.I shared a paper with Joana on encoding high dimensional spatial patterns into single numerical vector — one of those that I know will be useful to us but perhaps not just yet.I reviewed Gayll’s initial draft and Iu’s comments on the scoping document for our discovery work on modelling with encrypted data.We arrived in London, met Iu and headed to Parliament St.I gave an overview of what we do in the hub and our products and platforms. Then HMRC covered their workAdrian who heads up the area is keen to speak more about Churchill and to learn more about our environments.It was a really good first session. I always saw this as the start of some real collaboration #oneteamgov-data if you like. Since in some cases we are looking at two sides of the same coin. More to come and thanks to Edward for hosting us.We walked back to Kings Cross. I wrote most of these notes up on the way back, accompanied by some loud cockney lads heading to Newcastle. They mainly talked about football and Love Island. They offered me one of the many beers they had which was nice.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","I plan on this being the penultimate episode of season one of my #weeknotes.This week rounds off an incredibly tough but amazingly rewarding 90 weeks since I started in this role — Data Science Hub Lead for DWP in Newcastle.I took the post after expressing an interest in a twelve month temporary promotion. For a number of reasons outside of my control this was extended. The job was finally advertised externally — which I always knew it would be — a few weeks back. I submitted my application during episode four during my mammoth week in London. I haven’t spoken about any of this here up to now and its felt a bit strange not mentioning it. I love the job, love the team, love the challenge.All of my private sector friends find the whole thing very strange however I knew what I was signing up. In truth its been hanging over my head for quite some time and its taken its toll. I was interviewed for the post on Thursday.While I’m kind of on the subject and somewhat contradicting myself. A few blogposts I’ve read and some conversations I’ve had about my own #weeknotes have included opinions about whether or not including personal stuff is the right thing to do.I deliberately include references to some elements of my life outside work — mainly my kids — for two reasons.My head has been a little all over the place this week so these notes may be a little light on detail! After next week I’ll have a little break.I was on leave since it was the kids’ sports day, glorious sunshine.I did exchange some emails and messages about the application icon for Churchill and about an idea I had relating to publishing statistics.On the evening when the kids were at swimming I did some preparation for my interview.I was just about to step onto the bus when something in my head told me that I may have forgotten my work pass — I had — an about turn and an extra twenty minutes to my journey.When I got into the office I had to do a bit of calendar juggling. I chatted to Becky (data scientist product owner for Manhattan) — who was back from leave — to sort which meetings it was most important for me to attend.We chatted about a meeting we’re due to have with the Minister for Employment about our products — in particular how they work together as an ecosystem of insight on demand applications.Daniel (data scientist) arrived — also his first week back from leave. I had a chat with him and later Gayll (data scientist who oversees Greyhound and Manhattan) about a Greyhound meeting with some of the analytical community the day before.I turned up a little late for the Churchill backlog session. The meeting didn’t really go how any of us wanted. The aim was toIt ended up with me outlining a few things. Explaining some strategy and direction points and downing four cups of coffee in an hour and a half.I pinched a couple of opportunities to check emails. Dawn had asked a few weeks ago if I’d talk at the next Government Data Science Community of Interest. The confirmation email reminded me!A few of us stayed in the room to join Charlie’s prioritisation call. The next week or so has a few important meetings for each of the hubs. We also discussed cover for peak leave season.I had to miss the regular comms call to join Becky at a meeting about some discovery activity taking place which Alyson A is leading. Alyson and team — Jon M, Mark C, Emily B — are tasked with outlining user needs of different areas of the department and wanted to know more about Manhattan as effectively we will be users for them.It was a good conversation, we covered quite a broad set of things — I tend to go off at tangents. The team really liked the product and were interested in finding out more — we ran over time by quite a bit — so there will be more conversations. Jason and Graham crept into the meeting and emailed Becky and I afterwards to arrange a more detailed chat.I walked back with Becky who was joining a Next Tech Girls meeting — she is co-ordinating some of the activity with Joana (data scientist). I arrived late for my discussion with Gayll and Iu (London based data scientist in the Sheffield hub) about modelling with encrypted data.We discussed the scoping document and progress and ideas so far. This is a really important period — laying out the high (and then lower) level thought process for the analytical and methodological side of things. We discussed the need to think a little more about the broad path/direction, discuss approaches and begin to form a structure for the sub-phases of work. It was a good conversation. Between us all we have good contacts in this space to draw on. It is a really exciting and potentially game-changer.I had another chat with Becky, Stephen and Daniel about the Ministerial meeting and then with Stuart (data scientist product owner for Churchill) about using the name Churchill, Stu needed to engage with departmental lawyer folk, Gayll offered some useful pointers.I legged it out of the door to get back to coach my son’s football team. At bedtime my daughter asked if I could get back from work tomorrow to take her to Brownies (I usually work from home and do this but since my wife is now off for the summer I go into the office).On the commute in I watched the first half of Giorgia Lupi’s talk — I love her work.The one normal thing about my work week is that Wednesday is usually email day — this Wednesday didn’t turn out like that.I did a little more fine tuning on the case studies of how Churchill, Greyhound and Manhattan work as an emerging ecosystem — its very cool how they work both individually for their intended users and also together — I am silently proud of myself for this.Ash (who leads the team of developers who work with us on our applications) popped up with a practical question about sharing code for the IT Health Check for Churchill which we solved by speaking to the right people in the room.The I did get to process some emails. This included one which outlined what the first fifteen minutes of my interview would consist of — this distracted me somewhat. I got a message to say that the Ministerial meeting may not go ahead on Monday.Stephen brought my up to speed with some internal organisational changes that were taking place and then I called Kit.This was basically a pep talk. Kit is very astute, very supportive and lovely human being. The conversation included words like vulnerability, confidence , worrier and private sector. We ended up covering some other stuff too. Thanks Kit.On the commute back I watched more of the Giorgia Lupi talk and noted the following, which is insanely insightful.I got back in time to take my daughter to Brownies.I was on leave in the morning as it was the kids’ music performances at their junior school. I was really pleased my interview was in the afternoon as it was my daughter’s first — violin — and my son’s last — clarinet — performance at the school. They both also did guitar. I didn’t want to miss it. They get their musical talent from their Mam!After the performance I went for a coffee and scone with my wife and my Mam before heading into work in the afternoon. I sat in the atrium, popped my headphones in and read over my notes for the first part of the interview with The Killers blasting.I headed to my desk and found out that the Ministerial meeting was back on so sat with Daniel for a bit to get my head around a few things. It distracted me from the fact I had an interview in ten minutes.Then the interview.A quick catch up with Becky to discuss Monday, London, Minister stuff then home and crash.I walked the kids to school. My son’s last day in junior school.I headed into the office for a half day.Becky and I discussed some logistic stuff for Monday and then Jason and Graham arrived. They had some questions about Manhattan following the Tuesday meeting. Becky and I gave a detailed background and Becky gave a quick demo which went down well.I went for a chat with Paula (Head of the Data and Analytics Private Office) to thank her for her support during the whole application process — Paula is a great support generally.I had a few quick chats with the team then headed off for a night away in Northumberland with my wife for our 13th Wedding Anniversary.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","When I started the hub my vision — although I doubt I would ever have referred to it as such — was to developAll this with a principle of reusable micro-services, common design patterns (for 1 and 2) and most importantly (for 3) pragmatism and respect for where the organisation was, is and is going.Its starting to come togetherThis week has started the conversation about strategic needs. However there is still got a long long way to go.I said that I anticipated this being the final episode of this season — mainly because I hoped to be on leave for a few weeks after this . As it happens I’m around for half of next week so I’ll put in a bonus #halfweeknotes next week which will include presenting at the Government Data Science Community of Interest which I’m looking forward to.I was down in London for a meeting with the Minister for Employment.I travelled down with Becky (data product owner for Manhattan). When we arrived we caught up with Charlie to run through what we were each covering. Charlie then gave us a bit of an update about the Data and Analytics senior leadership team meeting. Some of this was linked to my thinking cap point in episode 6.While Becky familiarised herself with the QlikSense version of Manhattan on my SurfacePro — some things are ever so slightly different from her machine and the train wifi didn’t allow us to test while travelling — I took the opportunity to have a quick catch up with Iu about a few things. He reminded me — again — that he was going on leave for three weeks. He also prompted me about the joint good-cop bad-cop blogpost on data visualisation we’ve spoken about.We popped upstairs and met Pauline C (Deputy Director, Labour Market) who filled us in on a few things. I’ve seen Pauline talk at a few things before and she’s brilliant. I’ve only actually met her once, well over a year ago but she remembered which was nice.Into the meeting. We gave an overview of the Churchill, Greyhound and Manhattan applications. Their individual purposes and also demonstrating how they all work together. A couple of minor issues with wires and wifi but everything was well received and some good conversation and outcomes relating to the use of the applications for strategy. A quick debrief afterwards with Pauline and Charlie. Pauline said something which was great to hear about the applicationsI chatted with Iu about modelling with encrypted data — I’ve been thinking about a name for this piece of work but haven’t quite made my mind up yet. Iu had spoken positively with one of his contacts and made some additional ones so we’re gathering momentum on what is essentially a — potentially very valuable — R&D side-project at the minute.It was a bit of a flying visit. On the train back Becky and I chatted through a few ideas and I cleared some emails. It was Sree’s (data scientist) last day in the team which I was sorry to be missing, we all wish her well in her new role — which will be in another of Charlie’s teams.I was back in time to meet my wife and kids at a new climbing place.When I arrived in the office, Gayll (data scientist who oversees Greyhound and Manhattan) wanted a chat about a meeting she’d been invited to on Friday— Universal Credit Digital Transformation senior leadership team meeting — chaired by Deborah B.The invite stemmed from a series of conversations and interactions which I mentioned in episode 2 — Gayll had been leading things since then and wanted a quick chat about the scope/expectations outlined in the agenda since it covered a few things outside of our area of responsibility and asked if I’d join the meeting. We set up a team chat for Thursday and Gayll was going to gather some info from Iu and Luke.A quick change of buildings and into the team show & tell and retrospective. A different set up to normal as Stephen had organised a demo of a data blending and advanced data analytics tool. I then had to leave to call Philippa just at the point it turned into the regular meeting.I had a really great chat with Philippa who I met in episode 4 where I said I wanted to follow up and learn from her experiences as a (non data scientist) product owner/manager in/of a data science team. You may remember the subject reared its head again in episode 5 after I read Zoe asking what does a product owner own anyway and Louise talking about Directly Responsible Individuals in her #weeknotes.Philippa and I ended up talking a little more widely about what we each do and shared our thoughts and views on a few subjects which included.I love chats like that. Philippa subsequently sent me a blogpost link which contained the following which I liked.I’m still thinking about this subject but the chat made me even more clear that — to quote PhilippaI hope to chat to Zoe and Louise for their views — plus Zoe and I need to chat about her masterclass idea! Theres more to come on this I feel.I caught up with Stuart (data product owner for Churchill). He was delivering a workshop with pensions policy folk in London the following day. I was supposed to be joining him but Charlie needed me to cover some interviews in Sheffield instead. Stuart wanted to check he wasn’t missing anything. He’d had a crash course in Greyhound from Daniel (data scientist) and we covered some parts of the wider narrative.Alaine (delivery lead), Dave D (business analyst) joined us for a quick chat about working with users.I joined a Lync session which Becky had lined up which covered a potentially very useful data source for us. This could be useful in its own right but also could be really useful in breaking down some of the barriers between my teams products and Kit’s — part of a wider vision for a common data currency between operations and strategy/policy.I have to apologise for this next gif — I felt like I’d committed to a bit of a retro tv/film theme with Hannibal and Axel and then I wrote breaking down barriers and Kit and then this happened.I had a few conversations covering the Friday meeting in Harrogate and — unrelated — postcode shape files. In between I popped downstairs to buy a cake from Ben, George and Ash (developers) who are taking part in Tough Mudder and raising money for charity.In my notes for the day I wroteInterviewing in Sheffield with Billy (head of the Sheffield hub).Before that discussions with Alaine — on the phone on the train down — and then Max (program manager for Data Science) — when I arrived in Sheffield — about dependencies between our work and data architecture to feed into a Data and Analytics senior leadership team planning meeting.Back-to-back interviews all day for data scientist posts in Billy’s team. The final candidate didn’t turn up so I got away a little earlier. I phoned Stuart on the walk to the station to see how it had gone with pensions policy people. It turned out our trains were arriving back in Newcastle at the same time so we met up for a couple of beers.My son was really quite poorly through the night. For various summer holiday logistics reasons this meant I needed to be around in the morning until my wife was back to look after him so I didn’t get into the office until the afternoon.I met with Gayll, Becky and Daniel about the Harrogate meeting. We agreed the content, who does what, timings and the outcomes we’d hope for — Gayll had collated some views from elsewhere for us to incorporate.I was double booked next. I joined the IT health check update for Churchill private beta first. Outcome is, no major issues, still on track so should be making the application available externally to Kate and a few others very soon.We talked about the icon for the application. This is a draft of the current favourite which we think encompasses most of what we want to portray.The update finished early so I was able to join the second half of the meeting about Mercury — another R&D side-project — which Stephen and Daniel have been working on with Dawn S and Ian J (Data and Analytics Private Office). Mercury is looking to enhance the information they use and have access to. Some practical outcomes which Daniel and Ian will work together on.Harrogate for the Universal Credit Digital Transformation senior leadership team meeting.On the train, Daniel, Gayll and I talked about planning and I joined a call about resourcing with Charlie.Daniel familiarised himself with the QlikSense on my SurfacePro before we went into the meeting. We went in with the usual array of wires, connectors and cables but still needed Heather to help us out!Deborah and her team were very welcoming and asked really good questions. We presented the applications — a similar presentation as given to the Minister — and touched upon the common currency I mentioned earlier. A really good meeting with positive outcomes and actions.On the train back, I set up a call with Eddie after Kit connected us and I read a few blogposts including some from fellow #weeknoters — welcome Amanda.I liked James’ #oneteamgov three questions — he asked what is hard, what is fun and what makes you proud in your role. So here goes.What is hard? Being in the middle of a data and digital culture change venn diagram. The data product owner questions I’ve raised in these posts are a very tiny example (see also data visualisation designer) but more widely facilitating perspective shift is hard work — especially when it’s about data.What is fun? Working as part of a multidisciplinary team with a fantastic attitude to problem solving, challenge and change. We always find a way. As Stephen saysWhat makes me proud?The reactions to the products. As Pauline saidThat was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week."
