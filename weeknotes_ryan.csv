"I wrote hardly any notes this week— somewhat in an attempt to make the process of writing these notes quicker — I’m not sure it did. I definitely have a love hate relationship with writing — mainly hate to be honest.By way of contrast, this weeks gifs are flavours of happy — I’ve started reading Derren Brown’s book of the same name — exploring concepts of happiness.There is a short section at the end that contains something thats been on my mind this week, I’d welcome your thoughts.Bank Holiday — I genuinely can’t remember what I did but I wasn’t at work.My notes for Tuesday simply saidIt started ok — I caught up with Alaine first thing. We had a hub meeting scheduled and I wanted to hijack it to tie together people’s thoughts on a pile of planning asks. I then had a bit of time to blitz emails before heading into the meeting.I had to head out of work for an hour or so to drop my son at a thing. This meant I basically set the scene in the meeting and left — I felt bad about this and it disrupted my day somewhat but it was unavoidable.Now thatChurchill has moved into private beta — a proper thing out there scaling on the internet— how the beta phase worksGreyhound and Manhattan are approaching alpha — testing prototypes with users, finding and fixing problems, estimating costs and risks — how the alpha phase workswe have some decisions to make about resource and priorities across the hub. This meeting was a bit about that.I caught up with Alaine as I headed back and got some feedback from the meeting.One thing that has been evident from the outset of running the hub is that we are working on the edge of processes. In some cases this is because the processes are still being developed and in others its because what we need to do is non-standard. Both of these are beginning to conflate and become blockers upon blockers. But along the way we are delivering capability for others — which although its definitely the right thing to do, it can be quite intangible to some people.On top of this there are wider pressures to quantify the value of our products to the business. Given the nature of them, this is both frustrating and challenging.I joined the monthly cross hub call — and felt that I was quite downbeat and perhaps negative — although apparently I came across as realistic.I had the commute home from hell. I turned up the music loud. Stupid Tuesday.I didn’t write any notes for Wednesday.In the morning I worked on structuring my thoughts the planning asks plus emails about the Government Data Science Community meet up — Stephen and Alaine have been really helpful with this. I had a chat about some desk move stuff.I had to head out to drop my son at day two of the thing and got a good call in with Stuart about value — quantifying the savings of having far more efficient access to data — speeding up the investigative and iterative processes involved in policy, design, evaluation and briefing.I bought some biscuits for the team on the way back and had a chat with Iu who was in Newcastle for our meeting.Gayll, Iu and I met with Jack a PhD student specialising in cryptography and homomorphic encryption for cloud computing. It was our first meeting with Jack, a bit of a white-boarding meeting to discuss our ideas, which moved us forward slightly. Thinking about some of this stuff hurts my head.I worked on emails later in the day to make up for the time out of the office earlier — I feel like I get more emails than I ever have in this job, enquiries about data visualisation, sifting panels, presenting at something, advice on something — so I dealt with a few of those. I got a meeting organised to discuss design patterns and put my thoughts together on resourcing for Charlie.I finally got round to emailing Zoe to try and arrange a chat about product. Although we haven’t been able to pin down a time yet I’m excited to talk to her.I didn’t write any notes for Thursday either.On the commute I arranged to meet our new G7 data scientist for a coffee next week. I’m looking forward to meeting them.I had a lot of meetings on Thursday. I had a call with Charlie to sort some stuff out to do with my pay and then a chat with Gayll about something I’d forgotten to send out before I went on leave. Gayll helpfully tied the comms together with something she was doing anyway.I met Adam to talk about the data visualisation training we’ve been working on — Adam has been doing all the work. He covered the design pattern stuff and blogging amongst other things. It’d been a little while since we’d caught up so was good to talk and agree some actions.I was straight into a call with Kate from HM Treasury and Stuart about the Data for Policy Conference. I’ve been asked to talk about Churchill and to ‘bring along a policy maker’ to talk about their thoughts. The plan is background — demo — Kate’s thoughts.Kate gave some initial feedback on the application which was really useful — she was really positive about the Agile working and our ability to react and respond to user needs and gave some thoughts on additions. I left the call pretty content.Then it was into a Lync session with folks from the analytical community reciprocating their session last week and hopefully building some collaboration — otherwise there is a risk of some duplication.I spent the afternoon in a room with Alaine on lessons learned and planning which Charlie has asked for. I really struggle with planning — especially in an environment of R&D and innovation — I understand the need but in practice things change too quickly so plans end up so high level you wonder where the value is. It was a bit of a merry go round as I brought different people into the room to discuss aspects of their products — I didn’t make as much progress as I’d have liked but the session was helpful to draw out some significant challenges.I did make some notes.I tied up quite a few loose end emails including one to the Newcastle Analyst Group about an opportunity for Professor David Sumpter to come and talk to us about his book Soccermatics.As I was getting through emails the team were discussing at desk some of the challenges I mentioned earlier. They really are a brilliant group. I am always impressed by their ability to work together to solve complex problems in a logical and thoughtful way — and to embrace the process. I’m incredibly proud of the team.The Churchill team dialled into the first feedback session with HM Treasury. This was exciting since most DWP users have grown with the application whereas HMT colleagues were flying solo.We got some really helpful feedback on the design, performance and some detailed asks for future features. But here is a high level summaryI had quick exchanges with Stu and Ash afterwards and they were both pleased with the level of engagement and feedback.Then it was into a meeting with Kevin, Neil and Becky about Manhattan. To cut a long story short this was going through various permutations to ensure we balance utility of data with data quality, protection and security. We got to a resolution we think can workStephen then joined us to talk about some data movement challenges and we got to a resolution to that too we think. Kev was really helpful — Monday and Tuesday will be important days.Final meeting of the day was the regular show and tell with Charlie — explaining the challenges and proposed resolutions — and some of the responsibilities for Charlie — for Manhattan. The progress made by Joana, Daniel and Gayll on Greyhound — including some positive collaboration with the analytical community. Gayll talked about plans for Long Island and there was an update on Mercury — a side project Daniel and Stephen have been working on which lead to some discussion about environments and tooling other stuff with Charlie.I caught up with Charlie on the phone in the evening and a little bit on Saturday to discuss planning and comms.That was my week.Thought for the week.I’ve thought a lot about altruism this week.Consider this situation if you will.Now consider this.I’d welcome your thoughts.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","The first episode of season two, I’m back from leave, feeling refreshed and ready to go.I decided to continue with #weeknotes as — despite the pain of writing — the good outweighs the bad. I also think its important for data people to try and talk more in a non-data environment.I do need to adapt and evolve many aspects of the process and format. I’m going to be stricter with myself more generally — many people pointed out to me that I couldn’t continue at the pace I was before I was confirmed in the role — I was starting to break so I have some new rules.Overall this was a week of catching up and confirming or re-formulating the emerging plans that are in my head.This weeks gifs come courtesy of Tom Cruise. There are too many of them.I blitzed loads of emails on my commute — my thinking about having a work mobile is shifting — having resisted getting one for a long, long time, I’m making it work for me far more now I have one, especially in terms of clearing and responding to emails.When I got into the office I chatted with Stuart and Alaine. While I had been on leave Churchill moved into private beta — which for those unfamiliar with how government teams launch digital services is a public pre-release that isn’t open to everyone. In our case we’d made Churchill available to a few handpicked organisationsThe release had been delayed slightly as Stuart had to clarify some legal stuff.However everything went really smoothly in terms of technically making the application available to the outside world.This is a big milestone for the team. Churchill is the first service of its kind meaning they’ve had to contend with lots of challenges and shifting sands. They’ve approached it all with professionalism, tenacity and good humour. I’m really proud of everyone involved and immediate feedback was reassuringly positive.I had a quick chat with Stephen who was back from three weeks in Florida then had a walking meeting with Stuart before catching up with Joana, Daniel and Becky at desk. Loads to update me on, lots of which was to do with data. Data for Long Island — which the strategy work I mentioned towards the end of season one is now known as — data for Manhattan — the employer engagement application— plus some other very useful data which Daniel secured. Becky and I also discussed some stakeholder challenges. which we’ll need to address.I headed out with most of the team for a Churchill celebration pub lunch. It was a good opportunity to catch up. I was back in the office in time for a Lync session about a tool being developed within our analytical community looking at Labour Market information — big potential for collaboration here, despite some concerns about poor internal comms since each area should have known about each other’s work before now.I then had a call with Charlie. This was mainly a catch up but as usual we touched upon future direction and I picked up a few actions. Charlie is currently covering for Paul (Director of Data and Analytics) whilst he is on leave so is being dragged in a few directions.More clearing of emails on the commute. Tuesday became a day of post-leave email stuff. I contacted our new G7 data scientist who is currently in the midst of processes — hopefully not too long — I arranged to meet for a coffee when they return from leave.Lots of Data Science Hub stuff related to GDS with emails and comms relating toOn Tuesday GDS had also tweeted our Churchill blogpost from February. This seemed a bit randomHowever it prompted a few things including a request for an interview and interest from other Departments and organisations in using Churchill.I had a call about a potential hack event which also included some talk about OneTeamGov North that Shelley, Debbie and others are working on and which I’m keen to be involved in.I finally got an email out to a few people about data search — hopefully more to come on this.London. I got the train with Stephen which was a bit of a last minute thing. We had a good catch up on the journey. We’d both just returned from a period of leave so chatted about our time off and how we were both keen to get back into things now. We talked about Amazon Web Services, Woodstock — our emerging platform — and future plans.We met Iu at Caxton House and spent the morning talking about a variety of things including internal politics and the Government Data Science community meet up. When I was first asked to be involved in the four site event by Jane I suggested a broad theme for the day ofI chose this since I firmly believe that activity in government data science should be aimed towards developing capability and reusable products which lead to improved outcomes for people and society — rather than whizzy shiny things, novelty analysis, vanity projects and raising personal profiles. I think we need to keep the conversation on the right path.I was asked to talk on a topic so I suggested — scaling using the cloud. I’d then went on leave and forgot about it. Now I have to make sense of it. I always find it takes longer and more effort to prepare for a shorter presentation.Stephen, Iu and I got some broad ideas in place and talked about community and capability building more generally.Stephen and I then went our separate ways. I spent the afternoon on emails and admin. I spoke to Donna about some resourcing things, called Dan H to discuss the details for Thursday’s photoshoot and then passed on the news to the team – they’re getting used to emails starting — SURPRISE!I spoke to Stu about some planning stuff for Max and managed brief chats with Charlie and Chris.I had a few missed calls from Kit so called her back as I was leaving the building. We had a good chat covering my current thoughts and ideas, high level concepts and closer working plus some altruistic OneTeamGov type thoughts. We agreed to meet up soon to try and shake some of the ideas out of my head and join our thoughts up. It was nice to catch up.I was then a little behind schedule – as always tends to be the case – I had a brisk walk to Millbank for our weeknoters meet-up in a Harry Potter style room with lovely people. I was really looking forward to this but I wasn’t sure why.It was great meeting everyone in real life — it seemed that others in the group knew each other to various degrees — Matt knew everyone — but this was the first time I had met any of them in person. Although as Sam and Matt have pointed out, it kind of felt like I knew them which made it easier — especially for a wallflower like me.There was no set agenda and it could’ve been really awkard but Ben, Sam, Louise, Dan, Matt, Jonathan and Julie — others unfortunately couldn’t make it — made it an enjoyable experience talking about our thoughts, motivations and approaches for our #weeknotes.Some people take 30 mins, some take hours, some got into it for visibility, some to cure writers block, some are still trying it to see it if sticks, some have committed to it for a year. But everyone was pretty much as I’d imagined, primarily thoughtful — which I guess comes with the territory but and also genuine and just nice people.I think everyone really cares about what they do and I sense we have all learned a bit about ourselves from the process.Matt is very insightful and knowledgeable — he made me think about writing as a skill to be practiced, he also referred to us as a group of bloggers, I hadn’t considered myself a blogger. Thanks to him we all have #weeknotes and soon a new publishing domain. Thanks Matt.Overall Wednesday was a very long but enjoyable day. I was disappointed not to be able to join the group for drinks but I had completely lost track of time and I had to hotfoot it — to put it mildly — across London to catch my train back.(I accept that a Top Gun ‘need for speed’ gif may have been the obvious choice here but believe me this one is more representative)I feel that there could be a lot more to come from this talented group and I’d really like to meet up again and be involved with whatever inevitably transpires. I’m also looking forward catching up with Dan about some of the search work.I spoke with Stuart first thing about a variety of Churchill stuff and then with Becky about Manhattan and Long Island.Its really difficult to undersell the complexity of the challenges that Becky is facing and managing. Its a real balance and we need to make this visible to stakeholders more to manage their expectations.I got grief from Daniel (Sunderland fan), Becky (Nottingham Forest fan) and Joana (just joining in!) about the previous night’s Newcastle United match.I headed for a meeting with Ash who leads our partner team of software and data engineers. This was an initial chat about next steps and direction for Churchill but also covered some other aspects.We’ll have another meeting or two with others on the detail but broadly speaking we can now focus on bringing Greyhound and the interactive statistics dashboards – produced by our Statistical Services colleagues – “into” Churchill.Greyhound – currently an advanced prototype – will bring embedded analytics – in simple terms allowing users to very quickly identify high rates of change in certain metrics. The work will also open up more data to Greyhound users.Bringing the interactive dashboards — such as the Personal Independence Payment and Universal Credit ones — will bring efficiencies and improvements for users. Linked to this, Ash and I also talked about design patterns – general repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.GDS have some excellent design patterns for customer facing transactional services but the current service design manual doesn’t yet cater for design of data (visualisation) applications like ours.I have had intermittent conversations with Sam R at GDS about developing consistent design patterns for these purposes. In the mean time we will get our DWP house in order by working across our various data (visualisation) applications, including those from our hub, those from the stats world and those from Kit’s team to maintain consistency among our emerging designs.Stu and I had a walking meeting to talk about some of these plans and then joined Ash on a call with Charlie to cover high level lessons learned about the move to private beta and some time and resource plans.Then Stephen, Becky, Joana, Daniel and I made the short journey to Tyneview Park for our surprise photoshoot. Paul C signed us in and looked after us until it was time for the photos. It was great chatting to Paul and hearing about his work.Zara and her team were at Tyneview Park filming some of Paul’s colleagues. Dan H had also only let Zara know late in the day about photographing us so neither side really knew much about what was needed. In the end it was a fun session with a quite surreal — yet somewhat representative — mix of work and play.I’m looking forward to seeing the photos.A short day. I forgot to make any notes as I thought I would remember when I wrote it up — I totally didn’t.I had a call with Charlie in the morning to discuss some details of my new role.I then had a series of chats, phone calls and emails and left work at noon!That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.#weeknotes are blogposts about our working week. for us but shared with you.","A short week — I had hoped to take it as leave but agreed to cover some stuff for Charlie. Also the last episode of season one of my #weeknotes. I’m still deliberating over whether to commission a second season. I’ve enjoyed doing it and think it does me good to both take the notes and then write them up but as I’ve said before — numbers and pictures are my thing, words most certainly aren’t — so I do struggle with parts of this process.I’m looking forward to catching up with the other weeknoters on my first week back after leave and I’m pretty sure that will seal me continuing with it even if I do alter the format. Last week was all about the tv/film gifs this week, music.I sent a formal offer on Monday — to a new G7 data scientist who I hope will be joining my team — I’m excited to get another piece of the jigsaw.I got a formal offer on Tuesday — for my job — although still provisional. This was a relief as much as anything. Still a few things to sort out but I can finally start to plan properly. The last few months has been full of personal uncertainty. Hopefully I’ve sheltered the team from this. I’m pleased it was sorted before my leave.I forgot to write notes on Wednesday — I’m very much wishing I had and also that I’d written this up on Wednesday — so this may be a little brief in places.and on Thursday — I did a little work — but I did chill after that.I got through a few emails before my first meeting of the day. I still have too many emails to process. This is definitely a consequence of not working from home for the past few Wednesdays. I need a way to manage this better.My first meeting was a high level planning meeting for Manhattan with Becky, Daniel, Gayll and Alaine. Actually this was about separating activity for Manhattan as a product for Employer Engagement from activity more closely related to the strategy work I talked about last week. Becky is doing a very good job in keeping things separate.The team wanted to check there was no stray information stored in my head before I went on leave — plus for me to outline my thoughts on our approach to the strategy work, of which Manhattan type stuff will form the backbone — which i did. I do love a white board. We talked briefly about applying agile practices to R&D/analysis/data science. Its a topic thats rears its head every now and again — largely when we have to balance a few things in the team and split people’s time between products/projects — we tend to operate Kanban for this stuff. We’re still learning, there is always room for improvement but when in doubt pragmatism wins. Becky has Manhattan work to manage, Daniel is also working on Mercury but the discovery activity for the strategy work is important to scope out and lay foundations for.I will arrange more formal whole hub planning and prioritisation sessions when I return from leave — we will need two or three days. I want to define a broad work plan for the medium to long term based on the three parts of the vision I mentioned last week and then to break that plan down into well defined short term tasks. Plus its important to make all the other activity that people are involved in visible. I’m looking forward to starting this process.I called Eddie — Kit had suggested we talk. Eddie is a data scientist at Ministry of Justice Digital and broadly speaking was interested in data visualisation and embedding data science.We had a good chat. I ended up covering some of the conversation I’d had with Philippa the previous week about digital and data and we spoke in a little bit of detail about the work taking place in our respective teams. I said I would share some resources and information on data visualisation. We’ll speak again and meet soon.Charlie called me — he is/was supposed to be on leave but now that all the data scientist interviews are complete — there were a few things he wanted me to sort out with regard to some of the posts and offers.Neil T (Data Services) popped to my desk. Neil wanted my perspective/views on how a few pieces of work may or may not tie together. It was a really useful chat — effectively I talked about how a particular conceptually big and complicated piece of work could be broken down, what the components might look like, which bits were actually big and complicated and at a very high level what an MVP might look like for it.I then went into another meeting with Neil, this time with with Becky, Alaine and Kevin H (who is responsible for security and operational control within Data and Analytics). This was about Manhattan and also the strategy work. Neil walked us through the work he’d been doing on updating the data for Manhattan and we talked about some specific elements of the data plus also covered two factor authentication and audit capabilities for the application amongst a few other things relating to data for the strategy work. I expected the meeting to overrun — meetings with Kev usually do as they necessarily involve addressing lots of interesting and often very nuanced detail. It did overrun and resulted in some quite exciting outcomes and some wait and sees.London. Presenting at the Government Data Science Community of Interest which had a data visualisation theme.I’d decided to travel to London early to do a little preparation for the presentation. I bumped into Michael and later on Sree (who was heading to London for her first day in her new team) at the station. Michael is a front end and user experience designer (and a new data visualisation convert). He used to work with my team and now works with Kit. We spent a lot of the journey talking about design patterns and components and how we can best work together. We spoke in detail about some specific elements of the products we are working on in this respect — more to come from this hopefully.I parked myself in a coffee shop and had high hopes of prepping the material and then clearing some of email mountain. The presentation was mainly demo-ing Churchill and Greyhound however given the audience I wanted to put a couple of slides in for background and some gifs for effect.I mentioned in episode 3 that some of the content I’d prepared for Civil Service Live rendered better in Safari than Chrome or Firefox. I was reusing some of this so decided to make HTML slides and load the whole thing up in Safari to allow me to move seamlessly between slides, demos and gifs. A foolproof plan, nothing could go wrong.When I’m presenting, especially externally, I sometimes try to open with something about the particular date I’m presenting on, linked— usually tenuously — to the theme of the presentation. I find this makes people sit up and listen a bit more than hi I’m Ryan and I etc etc. So I prepared something for that.Occasionally — although more rarely and saved for longer talks— I extend this concept to amuse myself and keep peoples’ focus. For example I gave a talk at the Royal Statistical Society North Eastern Group at Newcastle University on Gary Barlow’s 40th birthday where I incorporated 40 song titles from his back catalogue into the talk.During the prep Charlie — still supposed to be on leave — phoned me with another couple of recruitment things which needed a phone call and a few emails. By the time I’d sorted that out I didn’t have time to get my teeth into my emails. Although one I did check notified me that we now had access to some data we wanted to look at so I made a quick call in to the office.I headed to the new Government Digital HQ in Whitechapel — fancy. I had a meeting first with Philippa and Louis H (Home Office) — it was their meeting but Philippa invited me to gatecrash during our conversation last week — it was good to hear Louis’ perspective on embedding data science invisibly into products and his experiences as a product manager.Dawn arrived to check the set up for presenters and informed us it would be via Chromecast which doesn’t always play nicely with Apple products and obviously works best with Chrome. It became immediately apparent that my Safari from a MacBook set up wasn’t going to be straightforward.Philippa kicked things off and Dawn talked about the Government Data Science Partnership which covered some of the content from her recent blogpost.I was next up. I’d been chatting to the tech support folks during Dawn’s session but despite all the fiddling and emailing, my laptop wouldn’t connect. Then it did — but wasn’t quite right. The we tried an HDMI cable — same problem. While they were contemplating an agenda shuffle I moved everything to Chrome and got it working. All of this took quite a bit of time.Given the delay I blasted through the presentation to try and recover the agenda timings — I had a train to catch and wanted to see the other presenters — I suspect it seemed rushed.It was the anniversary of the launch of MTV. I had faffed around and edited an image to get what I wanted to be shown on the screen at the start which was this...My intro linked the concerns and mixed attitudes of culture change — my tenuous take on the theme of Video Killed the Radio Star, the first music video shown on the station — with the work going on in my team. I’m not sure how it went down.I did the demos etc — I didn’t feel it went very well as I was going quickly and probably forgot to mention a few things — but the feedback during chats after was positive and I got some good questions —even if I felt I waffled a bit with some of the answers.As you can probably tell, overall I’m not sure I did the myself or the work justice.During the break I had to get photographed for the GDS Digital people blog which Dan H had interviewed me for during episode 3. I felt very self conscious.The second set of sessions were fromRobin from Ministry of Justice discussing interactive geographic modelling using Javascript and D3. Robin and his team are deploying browser based maps to policy customers. Check out one of the demos here.Tomas from the Alan Turing Institute talking about his work developing tools for open data-driven storytelling. This lets users easily create analyses and visualisations that are linked to the original open data source — making the analyses more transparent, reproducible, but also easy to adapt. Some neat ideas building on the what do you think type concepts developed by the New York Times and Office for National Statistics. Check out some of his early work here.It was my first visit to one of these meet ups — I enjoyed the sessions and hope to attend more. I didn’t get the chance to speak to many people but Emma, who has recently joined DWP as a Data Scientist did introduce herself and we had a quick chat before I dashed off back north. I’ve been on a few calls with Emma so it was good to put a face to the name/voice.Both the kids were poorly so I was a slightly later into the office than I’d hoped.I caught up with Becky and Daniel about the data we’d got access to — they’d had a look — seems some really valuable possibilities — more to come on this.Next I was covering for Charlie at a Data and Analytics planning meeting — one of a series. I read through all of the emails and documents to re-familiarise myself with the details. Paul Lodge, our Director was chairing. He talked through the state of play so far and I picked up an action.I’d rearranged my regular catch up with Alaine and extended it to allow us to refine our broad communications plan for our private beta-users. Churchill will be available externally — to selected users — imminently and whilst Stuart (data product owner) and I are on leave Alaine is in the driving seat. Ideally we would have been at this stage before the end of July — and before the periods of leave — but matters outside of our control delayed this. Regardless, the team should be very proud when they reach this milestone, its been a brilliant effort.Alaine and I laid out the path with a bit of flexibility to react and some decision points etc. I do love a flip chart. After that I got through the most pressing emails but didn’t get them all processed before heading off to meet my wife and kids for a meal.I spent part of the day completing the action I’d picked up from the planning meeting and then slammed my out of office on.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","When I started the hub my vision — although I doubt I would ever have referred to it as such — was to developAll this with a principle of reusable micro-services, common design patterns (for 1 and 2) and most importantly (for 3) pragmatism and respect for where the organisation was, is and is going.Its starting to come togetherThis week has started the conversation about strategic needs. However there is still got a long long way to go.I said that I anticipated this being the final episode of this season — mainly because I hoped to be on leave for a few weeks after this . As it happens I’m around for half of next week so I’ll put in a bonus #halfweeknotes next week which will include presenting at the Government Data Science Community of Interest which I’m looking forward to.I was down in London for a meeting with the Minister for Employment.I travelled down with Becky (data product owner for Manhattan). When we arrived we caught up with Charlie to run through what we were each covering. Charlie then gave us a bit of an update about the Data and Analytics senior leadership team meeting. Some of this was linked to my thinking cap point in episode 6.While Becky familiarised herself with the QlikSense version of Manhattan on my SurfacePro — some things are ever so slightly different from her machine and the train wifi didn’t allow us to test while travelling — I took the opportunity to have a quick catch up with Iu about a few things. He reminded me — again — that he was going on leave for three weeks. He also prompted me about the joint good-cop bad-cop blogpost on data visualisation we’ve spoken about.We popped upstairs and met Pauline C (Deputy Director, Labour Market) who filled us in on a few things. I’ve seen Pauline talk at a few things before and she’s brilliant. I’ve only actually met her once, well over a year ago but she remembered which was nice.Into the meeting. We gave an overview of the Churchill, Greyhound and Manhattan applications. Their individual purposes and also demonstrating how they all work together. A couple of minor issues with wires and wifi but everything was well received and some good conversation and outcomes relating to the use of the applications for strategy. A quick debrief afterwards with Pauline and Charlie. Pauline said something which was great to hear about the applicationsI chatted with Iu about modelling with encrypted data — I’ve been thinking about a name for this piece of work but haven’t quite made my mind up yet. Iu had spoken positively with one of his contacts and made some additional ones so we’re gathering momentum on what is essentially a — potentially very valuable — R&D side-project at the minute.It was a bit of a flying visit. On the train back Becky and I chatted through a few ideas and I cleared some emails. It was Sree’s (data scientist) last day in the team which I was sorry to be missing, we all wish her well in her new role — which will be in another of Charlie’s teams.I was back in time to meet my wife and kids at a new climbing place.When I arrived in the office, Gayll (data scientist who oversees Greyhound and Manhattan) wanted a chat about a meeting she’d been invited to on Friday— Universal Credit Digital Transformation senior leadership team meeting — chaired by Deborah B.The invite stemmed from a series of conversations and interactions which I mentioned in episode 2 — Gayll had been leading things since then and wanted a quick chat about the scope/expectations outlined in the agenda since it covered a few things outside of our area of responsibility and asked if I’d join the meeting. We set up a team chat for Thursday and Gayll was going to gather some info from Iu and Luke.A quick change of buildings and into the team show & tell and retrospective. A different set up to normal as Stephen had organised a demo of a data blending and advanced data analytics tool. I then had to leave to call Philippa just at the point it turned into the regular meeting.I had a really great chat with Philippa who I met in episode 4 where I said I wanted to follow up and learn from her experiences as a (non data scientist) product owner/manager in/of a data science team. You may remember the subject reared its head again in episode 5 after I read Zoe asking what does a product owner own anyway and Louise talking about Directly Responsible Individuals in her #weeknotes.Philippa and I ended up talking a little more widely about what we each do and shared our thoughts and views on a few subjects which included.I love chats like that. Philippa subsequently sent me a blogpost link which contained the following which I liked.I’m still thinking about this subject but the chat made me even more clear that — to quote PhilippaI hope to chat to Zoe and Louise for their views — plus Zoe and I need to chat about her masterclass idea! Theres more to come on this I feel.I caught up with Stuart (data product owner for Churchill). He was delivering a workshop with pensions policy folk in London the following day. I was supposed to be joining him but Charlie needed me to cover some interviews in Sheffield instead. Stuart wanted to check he wasn’t missing anything. He’d had a crash course in Greyhound from Daniel (data scientist) and we covered some parts of the wider narrative.Alaine (delivery lead), Dave D (business analyst) joined us for a quick chat about working with users.I joined a Lync session which Becky had lined up which covered a potentially very useful data source for us. This could be useful in its own right but also could be really useful in breaking down some of the barriers between my teams products and Kit’s — part of a wider vision for a common data currency between operations and strategy/policy.I have to apologise for this next gif — I felt like I’d committed to a bit of a retro tv/film theme with Hannibal and Axel and then I wrote breaking down barriers and Kit and then this happened.I had a few conversations covering the Friday meeting in Harrogate and — unrelated — postcode shape files. In between I popped downstairs to buy a cake from Ben, George and Ash (developers) who are taking part in Tough Mudder and raising money for charity.In my notes for the day I wroteInterviewing in Sheffield with Billy (head of the Sheffield hub).Before that discussions with Alaine — on the phone on the train down — and then Max (program manager for Data Science) — when I arrived in Sheffield — about dependencies between our work and data architecture to feed into a Data and Analytics senior leadership team planning meeting.Back-to-back interviews all day for data scientist posts in Billy’s team. The final candidate didn’t turn up so I got away a little earlier. I phoned Stuart on the walk to the station to see how it had gone with pensions policy people. It turned out our trains were arriving back in Newcastle at the same time so we met up for a couple of beers.My son was really quite poorly through the night. For various summer holiday logistics reasons this meant I needed to be around in the morning until my wife was back to look after him so I didn’t get into the office until the afternoon.I met with Gayll, Becky and Daniel about the Harrogate meeting. We agreed the content, who does what, timings and the outcomes we’d hope for — Gayll had collated some views from elsewhere for us to incorporate.I was double booked next. I joined the IT health check update for Churchill private beta first. Outcome is, no major issues, still on track so should be making the application available externally to Kate and a few others very soon.We talked about the icon for the application. This is a draft of the current favourite which we think encompasses most of what we want to portray.The update finished early so I was able to join the second half of the meeting about Mercury — another R&D side-project — which Stephen and Daniel have been working on with Dawn S and Ian J (Data and Analytics Private Office). Mercury is looking to enhance the information they use and have access to. Some practical outcomes which Daniel and Ian will work together on.Harrogate for the Universal Credit Digital Transformation senior leadership team meeting.On the train, Daniel, Gayll and I talked about planning and I joined a call about resourcing with Charlie.Daniel familiarised himself with the QlikSense on my SurfacePro before we went into the meeting. We went in with the usual array of wires, connectors and cables but still needed Heather to help us out!Deborah and her team were very welcoming and asked really good questions. We presented the applications — a similar presentation as given to the Minister — and touched upon the common currency I mentioned earlier. A really good meeting with positive outcomes and actions.On the train back, I set up a call with Eddie after Kit connected us and I read a few blogposts including some from fellow #weeknoters — welcome Amanda.I liked James’ #oneteamgov three questions — he asked what is hard, what is fun and what makes you proud in your role. So here goes.What is hard? Being in the middle of a data and digital culture change venn diagram. The data product owner questions I’ve raised in these posts are a very tiny example (see also data visualisation designer) but more widely facilitating perspective shift is hard work — especially when it’s about data.What is fun? Working as part of a multidisciplinary team with a fantastic attitude to problem solving, challenge and change. We always find a way. As Stephen saysWhat makes me proud?The reactions to the products. As Pauline saidThat was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","I plan on this being the penultimate episode of season one of my #weeknotes.This week rounds off an incredibly tough but amazingly rewarding 90 weeks since I started in this role — Data Science Hub Lead for DWP in Newcastle.I took the post after expressing an interest in a twelve month temporary promotion. For a number of reasons outside of my control this was extended. The job was finally advertised externally — which I always knew it would be — a few weeks back. I submitted my application during episode four during my mammoth week in London. I haven’t spoken about any of this here up to now and its felt a bit strange not mentioning it. I love the job, love the team, love the challenge.All of my private sector friends find the whole thing very strange however I knew what I was signing up. In truth its been hanging over my head for quite some time and its taken its toll. I was interviewed for the post on Thursday.While I’m kind of on the subject and somewhat contradicting myself. A few blogposts I’ve read and some conversations I’ve had about my own #weeknotes have included opinions about whether or not including personal stuff is the right thing to do.I deliberately include references to some elements of my life outside work — mainly my kids — for two reasons.My head has been a little all over the place this week so these notes may be a little light on detail! After next week I’ll have a little break.I was on leave since it was the kids’ sports day, glorious sunshine.I did exchange some emails and messages about the application icon for Churchill and about an idea I had relating to publishing statistics.On the evening when the kids were at swimming I did some preparation for my interview.I was just about to step onto the bus when something in my head told me that I may have forgotten my work pass — I had — an about turn and an extra twenty minutes to my journey.When I got into the office I had to do a bit of calendar juggling. I chatted to Becky (data scientist product owner for Manhattan) — who was back from leave — to sort which meetings it was most important for me to attend.We chatted about a meeting we’re due to have with the Minister for Employment about our products — in particular how they work together as an ecosystem of insight on demand applications.Daniel (data scientist) arrived — also his first week back from leave. I had a chat with him and later Gayll (data scientist who oversees Greyhound and Manhattan) about a Greyhound meeting with some of the analytical community the day before.I turned up a little late for the Churchill backlog session. The meeting didn’t really go how any of us wanted. The aim was toIt ended up with me outlining a few things. Explaining some strategy and direction points and downing four cups of coffee in an hour and a half.I pinched a couple of opportunities to check emails. Dawn had asked a few weeks ago if I’d talk at the next Government Data Science Community of Interest. The confirmation email reminded me!A few of us stayed in the room to join Charlie’s prioritisation call. The next week or so has a few important meetings for each of the hubs. We also discussed cover for peak leave season.I had to miss the regular comms call to join Becky at a meeting about some discovery activity taking place which Alyson A is leading. Alyson and team — Jon M, Mark C, Emily B — are tasked with outlining user needs of different areas of the department and wanted to know more about Manhattan as effectively we will be users for them.It was a good conversation, we covered quite a broad set of things — I tend to go off at tangents. The team really liked the product and were interested in finding out more — we ran over time by quite a bit — so there will be more conversations. Jason and Graham crept into the meeting and emailed Becky and I afterwards to arrange a more detailed chat.I walked back with Becky who was joining a Next Tech Girls meeting — she is co-ordinating some of the activity with Joana (data scientist). I arrived late for my discussion with Gayll and Iu (London based data scientist in the Sheffield hub) about modelling with encrypted data.We discussed the scoping document and progress and ideas so far. This is a really important period — laying out the high (and then lower) level thought process for the analytical and methodological side of things. We discussed the need to think a little more about the broad path/direction, discuss approaches and begin to form a structure for the sub-phases of work. It was a good conversation. Between us all we have good contacts in this space to draw on. It is a really exciting and potentially game-changer.I had another chat with Becky, Stephen and Daniel about the Ministerial meeting and then with Stuart (data scientist product owner for Churchill) about using the name Churchill, Stu needed to engage with departmental lawyer folk, Gayll offered some useful pointers.I legged it out of the door to get back to coach my son’s football team. At bedtime my daughter asked if I could get back from work tomorrow to take her to Brownies (I usually work from home and do this but since my wife is now off for the summer I go into the office).On the commute in I watched the first half of Giorgia Lupi’s talk — I love her work.The one normal thing about my work week is that Wednesday is usually email day — this Wednesday didn’t turn out like that.I did a little more fine tuning on the case studies of how Churchill, Greyhound and Manhattan work as an emerging ecosystem — its very cool how they work both individually for their intended users and also together — I am silently proud of myself for this.Ash (who leads the team of developers who work with us on our applications) popped up with a practical question about sharing code for the IT Health Check for Churchill which we solved by speaking to the right people in the room.The I did get to process some emails. This included one which outlined what the first fifteen minutes of my interview would consist of — this distracted me somewhat. I got a message to say that the Ministerial meeting may not go ahead on Monday.Stephen brought my up to speed with some internal organisational changes that were taking place and then I called Kit.This was basically a pep talk. Kit is very astute, very supportive and lovely human being. The conversation included words like vulnerability, confidence , worrier and private sector. We ended up covering some other stuff too. Thanks Kit.On the commute back I watched more of the Giorgia Lupi talk and noted the following, which is insanely insightful.I got back in time to take my daughter to Brownies.I was on leave in the morning as it was the kids’ music performances at their junior school. I was really pleased my interview was in the afternoon as it was my daughter’s first — violin — and my son’s last — clarinet — performance at the school. They both also did guitar. I didn’t want to miss it. They get their musical talent from their Mam!After the performance I went for a coffee and scone with my wife and my Mam before heading into work in the afternoon. I sat in the atrium, popped my headphones in and read over my notes for the first part of the interview with The Killers blasting.I headed to my desk and found out that the Ministerial meeting was back on so sat with Daniel for a bit to get my head around a few things. It distracted me from the fact I had an interview in ten minutes.Then the interview.A quick catch up with Becky to discuss Monday, London, Minister stuff then home and crash.I walked the kids to school. My son’s last day in junior school.I headed into the office for a half day.Becky and I discussed some logistic stuff for Monday and then Jason and Graham arrived. They had some questions about Manhattan following the Tuesday meeting. Becky and I gave a detailed background and Becky gave a quick demo which went down well.I went for a chat with Paula (Head of the Data and Analytics Private Office) to thank her for her support during the whole application process — Paula is a great support generally.I had a few quick chats with the team then headed off for a night away in Northumberland with my wife for our 13th Wedding Anniversary.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","The theme of this week is most definitely collaboration. Continuing it, valuing it, respecting it and instigating it. Vive la collaboration!Late back from Center Parcs but caught up with Charlie about the interviews I’d missed in Newcastle. Can’t say much more yet.I checked emails on the metro into work until I got stuck in a tunnel. I was supposed to join a meeting with Charlie and didn’t get out until after the call had finished so sent him a message to apologise. Charlie updated me on the meeting I missed. A positive and potentially exciting outcome.When I got in the office I caught up with Alaine (Delivery Lead) who was back from a couple of weeks leave. We walked across to join the Churchill mid-sprint review meeting — which included biscuits — with Ben, George, Alastair, Massimo, Ash (Developers) and Dave D (Business Analyst)We covered some high level themes and the importance ofWe discussed themed sprints, scheduled releases and reviewed the Jira board for this sprint, a few things blocked (really bottle necked) in QA.We agreed that the next sprint would be a slack sprint for the developers to cover some elements of technical debt and allow us to take stock and fully detail upcoming designs and review and add to the current backlog.We also had a quick chat about ideas for potential hack events and Ash gave an update about the production environment for private beta (looking good) and the IT health check (some money needed).When I got back to my desk I had a chat with Gayll and Joana (Data Scientists) to sort some travel and agenda details for Friday for our meeting with the Data Science team at HMRC. Dennis (Programme Team) popped over to ask if I could interview in Sheffield on Thursday as Billy (Sheffield Hub lead) had covered the first set of Newcastle ones on Monday.I caught up with Ash briefly about the mid-sprint review, he gave good feedback about how it had gone. I then headed off early for my daughter’s end of term assembly. On the journey back I got an email from Max so gave her a quick call just as she was heading into the main meeting to discuss all the 17/18 planning that had been taking place.I caught up with Charlie later on to see how that meeting had gone. It was an important one, the outcome was — more challenges than opportunities — the need to put our thinking caps on.Normally this is working from home day so I can do the school run but since my wife is a teacher who has now broken up, for the next eight weeks I will be in the office. It remains however a day to deal with emails. One discussion that came up was about the name Churchill and whether when we make the application public we will run into any problems. Billy said he was happy to cover the Sheffield interviews — so I didn’t have to travel — Billy is also covering interviews the following Monday (Sheffield) and Thursday (Newcastle) as I already had leave booked in. I owe him one. Throughout the day I was exchanging messages with Charlie about my reflections, thoughts and ideas.I chatted with Stephen, he’d just returned from delivering a hybrid version of the data vis training with Adam that Catherine had set up.Our data visualisation community — Adam is leading on this with Paul — are in the process of revamping the training to make it a self-lead web version. This was an opportunity to test some of the examples out — good feedback — people love examples to aid learning.I joined the weekly Data Science Function prioritisation meeting. Charlie talked about priorities for the next quarter and each hub plus the programme team gave updates.I had a few chats with Dave D. He showed me the latest additions to Churchill on the QA server — we’re iterating to a really good place — and we spoke about testing resource.I got some paper and started to sketch out the ‘picture on the jigsaw box’ — I’m conscious that sometimes I am the only one with this picture. More on this in a later episode probably.Adam popped up and we spoke about the training. I’ve got to send him some links. We had a good chat about community working and the benefits of a collaborative attitude over, erm, other behaviours.I headed to my son’s leavers assembly.I asked Dan some questions about his work. I’d like a proper chat with him, both about work and just generally.The end of the day was more sifting. I am now pretty confident of the broad segmentation I have formed in my head of types of data scientist applicants.I arrived in the office slightly late for my regular meeting with Alaine, we both grabbed a coffee and headed to the atrium.We had a bit to catch up on after Alaine’s leave and since her return she had been focusing on the detail and money needed for the IT health check. We caught up about that, resourcing, some important upcoming cross government and ministerial meetings/presentations and discussed the need for (me to do) some longer term planning — jigsaw box picture stuff. There is a reason why I haven’t yet which I’ll perhaps discuss in a later episode.Stuart wandered past on his way into the office and joined us. It was his first day back after a week in the sun — Alaine and I brought him up to speed with the actions/outcomes from the mid sprint review, the naming discussion and the latest additions to the app.I caught up with Stu on a walk to the cash point and then headed to the Action Learning Sets meetingI really like our little group; Fiona, Ann, Matt, Catherine and the newest recruit Donna. I can’t talk about these meetings but what I will say is I was sceptical about the concept but I’ve changed my mind.After this I finally logged on. I joined an all staff call lead by Mayank (DG for Digital). Stuart then showed me some of the new data items in QA on Churchill which look cool. I then got a cold call from a supplier.Before I left I had a chat about my thoughts on open data possibilities on the back of Nick’s Government Data Publishers meeting.I headed to my son’s cricket training and on the way spoke to Charlie about some upcoming presentations where I need to be on point.Later on I pulled together a — too big — set of links for Adam, a collation of blogs, presentations, tools, thought pieces, some of which will make it onto the resources section of the training site.London. With Joana, Gayll and Iu. Visiting Adrian, Edward, Martin, Gavin, Mike and Ben who are working on HMRC data science exploration, data exploitation and related projects.On the train down I reviewed some of my recent notes/scrawls to see what needed to be kept — I am constantly writing, rewriting and reformulating notes.I shared a paper with Joana on encoding high dimensional spatial patterns into single numerical vector — one of those that I know will be useful to us but perhaps not just yet.I reviewed Gayll’s initial draft and Iu’s comments on the scoping document for our discovery work on modelling with encrypted data.We arrived in London, met Iu and headed to Parliament St.I gave an overview of what we do in the hub and our products and platforms. Then HMRC covered their workAdrian who heads up the area is keen to speak more about Churchill and to learn more about our environments.It was a really good first session. I always saw this as the start of some real collaboration #oneteamgov-data if you like. Since in some cases we are looking at two sides of the same coin. More to come and thanks to Edward for hosting us.We walked back to Kings Cross. I wrote most of these notes up on the way back, accompanied by some loud cockney lads heading to Newcastle. They mainly talked about football and Love Island. They offered me one of the many beers they had which was nice.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","SolidarityI’ve just got back from a long weekend away in Center Parcs so a late and hastily pulled together four day #weeknotes for episode 5.I get this voice in my head sometimes it says, “but Ryan, this is different to how things are being done at the minute”. Sometimes it’s mischievous, sometimes it’s cautionary — it is both the angel and devil on my shoulder.If I have an idea or a concept, especially one which might result in “change” I think about it deeply and intensely, from every angle, possibility and perspective. I obsess about it. The pitfalls, the impacts and the likely naysayers — what they’ll say and why — I find this to be a good test. Mostly I think the possibilities and inter-connections with other things — the combined benefits.The concept of data product owners — emphasis on data-product — has been one such concept that had that voice shouting at me quite a lot over the last year so I was very pleased to read this blogpost from Trey this week and was pleased with the discussion when I tweeted about it.This — and also Dan proposing a #weeknote-ers meet-up plus Matt proposing an event on blogging — made me reflect on the importance of people who blog and work and talk in the open. Much respect to everyone who does it.Monday.My daughter was poorly so I was slightly late into the office, setting up a bed on the sofa, Matilda on the TV — her go-to ‘poorly movie’, and getting cuddles whilst waiting for my Mam.First up was a walking meeting with Stuart about Churchill private beta.Then I had a great conversation with Kevin H (data security and operational control), Iu and Gayll (data scientists) about modelling with encrypted data. I knew this would be right up Kev’s street. I outlined my thoughts on scope and direction. Kev was equally excited about the possibilities and happy to sponsor the work. Iu and Gayll are going to write a scoping document. Genuinely game changing possibilities with this.I had a very quick chat with Stephen S in my team about the ODI toolbox that Stephen F had presented last week at Government data publishers community.Becky (Data Product Owner for Manhattan) had a variety of things to chat to me about which had rolled over from last week when I wasn’t in the office.Then Stephen B arrived at my desk. Stephen is the new Head of Statistical Services, a Deputy Director within Data and Analytics. I’ve met Stephen a few times previously and I really like him. He was in Newcastle for a couple of days meeting his teams up here and had asked for an overview of what we do in the Data Science Hub. I covered that and our links with his folks.Then it was our fortnightly comms call. The regular attendees are Charlie, Nicola, Rachel and Rachel. Nicola talked about some DWP Digital events to bring people together. A number of objectives including showcasing and also focusing on the practice model. We also talked about potential hack events.I grabbed a quick coffee and dialled into the Employer engagement delivery improvement project steering group meeting. Manhattan was the first agenda item. We got the go ahead along with some really insightful and strategic questions, which I liked.I discussed some Churchill comms stuff with Dave B (business analyst) and then took a call from Max (program manager for Data Science).Much like in episode 1 a call with Max pretty much obliterated my Tuesday. I had a beautiful looking gap in my calendar which I’d planned to use to review data visualisation training but that quickly disappeared.I left a little early to see my daughter and so my Man could get away and prepare for her holiday.I read Louise’s #weeknotes. Louise mentioned DRIs (DirectlyResponsible Individuals) which intrigued me in respect to data product owners as a concept.I had a quick conversation with Charlie about embedded analytics and stats products and spent quite some time sifting applications.TuesdayMy daughter was still poorly. I worked from home.Paula (Head of the Data and Analytics Private Office), Barrie (Data Services) and Nigel (Statistical Services) called me for our — Newcastle based Grade 6 people — meeting about a Data and Analytics leadership initiative. The meeting finished early, we challenged the ask quite bit and Barrie took a couple of actions to clarify some things before we decided how best to proceed.I chatted to Ash — who was travelling to Leeds — about the call from Max the day before, we spoke about resource, specifically technical architects and data architects.I dialled into the weekly prioritisation call which Charlie leads with the hubs in Newcastle, London and Sheffield plus the programme team. Charlie had some month end reporting needs, I added a few more things for him to consider. I covered some of our cross-government (#oneteamgov?) data conversations. Billy (Sheffield hub lead) talked about operationalising of natural language processing.I called Max and Rob (data science programme team) to discuss resourcing and some reformatting of the 17/18 plan.I called Gayll, a call which began about one thing but ended up being a quick Greyhound strategy/comms chat.I called Becky, a call which began about one thing but ended up being a quick Manhattan strategy/comms chat plus.I caught up on some emails form last week and emailed Gayll about some opportunities.Max called and we talked about technical architects and data architects. Then Rob joined and we spoke further about plans and costs.More emails. Then a call with Charlie, Max, Kevin D (Data Services), David B (Data Architecture), Paul G (agile delivery manager) about the 17/18 plans. The call finished early. I don’t envy Max and Kev who have a challenging role pulling it all together but are doing a great job.More emails.Charlie called. Paul L (Director of Data and Analytics) had asked for our thoughts and ideas on something.I read Zoe’s blogpost which I really liked but further confused my thoughts in respect to data product owners as a concept.More emails. More planning. More sifting.I read Iu’s internal data science newsletter which covered the subject of workflow.I worked until quite late refining plans and defining risks.WednesdayProper work from home day. My daughter was well enough to return to school so I walked her and my son round the corner.I phoned Max — more emails had been exchanged late on — I said I’d supply a few more words related to long term vision.I joined a call about hacks which Nicola and Charlie were on. I contacted John (a statistician at DfT) I’ve worked with John before and wanted to pick his brains about about the DfT Hackathon. John put me in touch with Tom.I tried — many times! — to Lync into the cross hub show and tell. It was Newcastle’s turn. Stephen was talking about his work on our environments and Becky giving the lifecycle of Manhattan; moving from prototyping using an off the shelf visualisation tool to developing a bespoke desktop application via all the discussions about data access, data security, ethics, memoranda of understanding. Becky has done one hell of a job. Unfortunately I didn’t hear any of it due to technical problems!I phoned Stephen. We spoke for a little while about.More planning and words conversations. I’m pleased to have Charlie as a boss.More emails before heading to pick the kids up from after school cricket (son) and guitar (daughter) then a quick turnaround for a Brownies trip (daughter) and school disco (son).I mentioned in episode 1 that each site holds monthly Directorate level ‘stand ups’ lead by a Grade 6 — to give some updates and to get some feedback. It was my turn on Thursday morning so I did some prep. Charlie sent through something I needed.I read this article about wheat plots (possibly aka stripograms) and then saw an example in the wild from John.More emails. There were still lots of fiddly ones hanging around and thats what I do on Wednesdays.ThursdayIt was lashing down!I had a chat with Gayll about communities of practice and also about our upcoming cross gov meetings.I went for a chat with Paula about the G6 stand up to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Its always good to chat to Paula.Tom (Statistical Services) was joining the Newcastle stand up to give a Sheffield perspective and I caught up with him beforehand. Catherine appeared with the certificate and trophy from the GSS award.I did the stand up. Lots of comms talk, communities of practice and Tom gave an overview of his areas and some of his work on interactive statistics dashboards — which went down well — then Catherine talked about the award. Barrie caught Tom and I for a chat related to dashboards. I then spoke to Tom about my thoughts on open data, collaboration and the Government data publishers community.I sat with Sree who gave me an update on her R&D work on sequential consensus pattern mining. We started simple but the power of this methodology will be for more complex state based data.Then I joined Catherine, Stephen, Adam, Paul and Mark to talk about the data visualisation training. Some great progress but also highlighting the challenges of what we are trying to do, it’ll be worth it though.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.","Very unusually, I was in London for pretty much the full working week attending and presenting at various different events that I’d been invited to. As such I’ve split out some of the write ups of the specific events into #daynotes to avoid it being too massive — also I’ve had a few people mention to me this week that they enjoy the weeknotes which is nice to hear.I was surrounded by more different types of personalities than I’m used to in one go this week from sales people, to journalists to outgoing and enthusiastic public servants, I’ve never felt more INTJ.London is a place of extremes and whilst it has some amazing qualities I was pleased to be back in the North East by Friday evening. I wrote the first part of this as I sat on the floor of a jam packed train to Newcastle for three and a half hours.Whilst a lot of that sounds a little negative, the week was actually incredibly positive. There are some amazing things happening at the minute which are gathering real momentum really and I’m pleased to be playing a (very small) part in it.Some good themes and questions came out over the course of the week, I’ll pick three.2. People are finding it too hard to answer easy questions.3. Connections are outcomes.I’ve made some great connections this week and I haven’t worked out all the questions I have yet.MondayI said goodbye to the kids and headed for the station to meet Stephen who leads a lot of the technology side of the team. Stephen updated me on a few things and we had a good chat on the way to London.We headed to Caxton House first. I’d been due to meet Kit and Stephen was meeting Phil B from Kit’s team. It ended up that we all met together and Luke also joined us . We headed across the road to meet.Phil and Luke asked me a load of questions about my team and what we’ve been up to. We talked about areas we could collaborate. Luke is going to speak to Sree about our work sequential pattern analysis (state based sequences and lead lag dynamics). Stephen and Phil talked about AWS.Kit and I then headed off for our original chat. I’d asked Kit‘s advice on something and she was helpful and supportive -as always. It was nice to catch up.Stephen and I headed for the hotel via cable car. I FaceTimed the kids -my daughter asked what I did for a job as they’d been talking about that stuff at school. I then met Stephen for some food and a few drinks and we ended up meeting the organisers of tomorrow’s event in the hotel bar. We were there until quite late.TuesdayPublic Sector Show — I’ve outlined my thoughts/experiences of the event in the #daynotes here. Below is the stuff the happened in between.Before lunch I made a couple of phone calls. I spoke to Max (program manager for Data Science) about a meeting that was taking place that afternoon to do with 17/18 planning. There had been a flurry of discussions about resources so we caught up to talk about that.I phoned Stuart. Loads of activity around the move to private beta for Churchill plus a lot of other peripheral discussions. We spoke about the work to configure the content delivery network and production virtual machines plus the IT health check, which is dependent on the end to end configuration being complete. We also spoke about some comms stuff and keeping the private beta users fully up to date. We have a bit of planned leave in and around the move so Stuart and I are speaking frequently.Before we went for lunch someone tried to sell Stephen and I a 360º wifi enabled, motion sensor, security system. After lunch I spoke with someone about software testing then headed to the start of the afternoon sessions which began with some sessions by the sponsors.During the afternoon Stephen and I bumped into Ben D (GDS data scientist) who was about to present the session with Philippa P (GDS product owner). Ben and I first met a couple of years ago when he was working for HMRC and was talking about some work he’d done at an event. I took too much of his time up asking questions. Ben came up to Newcastle in the very early days of me setting up the hub and met the team. He’s always been really helpful, is really enthusiastic and a great connection-maker.Ben introduced me to Philippa who joined the team in March. This was great! One of the things in my head at the minute is the question of what it means to be a ‘data product owner’.I need to follow up with Philippa I’m hoping she will be able to help me learn from her experiences.During the afternoon sessions Becky (product owner for Manhattan) messaged me as something had cropped up and she wanted my view by a certain time. I figured I could fit a call in before one of the afternoon sessions. Becky had a choice to make about an upcoming board meeting where Manhattan would be discussed. It was a tricky decision but Becky made the right call.Stephen and I spoke to the people at the AWS stand at the end of the day and then Charlie chaperoned me safely back across London in the rain and we had a good chat about strategy. I checked into a different hotel which would be my base for the rest of the week and FaceTimed the kids.There’d been more emails and unexpected surprises for 17/18 planning which stemmed from the meeting I missed in the afternoon, this time around priorities and scope. There is a moral to this story somewhere.I got in touch with Ash (heads up the software development team in Data and Analytics) and arranged to talk to him the following morning to get his views. I had a quick chat with Charlie about it all.WednesdayGovernment Data Publishers Community. I’ve outlined my thoughts/experiences of the event in the #daynotes here. Below is the stuff the happened in between.The event wasn’t until later so I worked in the hotel at the start of the day, clearing some emails. I tried to phone Corinne (Head of Data and Analytics Live Services) to get her views but couldn’t get in touch — I think because she was at the DWP Digital Leaders event in Leeds. I was sorry to miss the event but I’d agreed with Nick I’d present at his group if I could and since I was down in London anyway this made most sense. Ash phoned and we talked through the questions on priorities and scope. The issue was largely a question of risk. Ash and I were in agreement about the best course of action.I decided to walk to Clerkenwell for the event. I usually keep my visits to London down to one day, travel underground, pop up where I need to be and then get the hell out of dodge.I left the hotel and walked for about ten minutes before I realised I was going in completely the wrong direction but still arrived in plenty of time.I wasn’t really sure what I’d been asked to present at and this was only the third meeting of the group so I was interested to see what it was all about. I’ve been asked to speak about the Churchill quite a bit recently from a number of different perspectives today’s angle was the open data one.I felt it went down really well. There was a good level of enthusiasm and an acceptance of the challenges of design and scope .The ‘can I have one’ reaction from Lucy (Open Data lead at Devon County Council) has been a reassuring theme. I also got some questions about standards, linking up and collaboration across government. Blanca (interaction designer at GDS) asked some insightful questions about UX/UI challenges. Michael from Ordnance Survey asked about our plans for geographical dispersion data, I talked briefly about Manhattan and how the ecosystem of applications will grow.I need to follow up withI got back to to the hotel relatively late and after I’d FaceTimed home I spoke to Charlie. He’d got back from the Leeds event and we needed to sift some applications and compare notes with Billy (who leads the Sheffield Hub). I then blitzed a load of emails and checked messages — including Stuart (product owner for Churchill) letting me know he could no longer travel to London for our joint presentation on Friday so I would be flying solo.Even later on I got a message from Alan (Data Visualisation Editor at The Financial Times) saying I was welcome to join him for drinks if I was free the following evening.ThursdayOneTeamGov. I’ve outlined my thoughts/experiences of the event in the #daynotes here. Below is the stuff the happened in between.A call had been arranged to talk about the 17/18 plans and the question of priorities and scope. I was unable to join due to the unconference so called Corinne on the walk to Haymarket — no answer so left a message.I registered and grabbed a drink. A combination of the I in INTJ and overall shyness means I very rarely instigate conversations at these sort of events. For some reason this morning I decided to. The guy I spoke to turned out to work in the Data Science space and we had a good conversation about the interface between people and data. Fiona (Head of User Research at DWP) then arrived. We had a natter and she introduced me to Sophie. Fiona and I worked together on a customer segmentation project a few years age that was a lot of fun.Corinne rang me back and we had a very quick call about risks and then I was into the start of the event. I sat next to Lucy who I’d met the day before and had a chat ahead of Kit introducing the event.I’d been encouraged to pitch by Kit. I welcomed the encouragement since at an event aimed at bringing together together policymakers, service designers, digital professionals and cross-sector experts, I wanted to make sure data was part of the conversation. So despite a few nerves I pitched a session to discuss data -Talk Data to Me- a title shamelessly borrowed from a webinar series.My initial reflection on the session was that it was a good discussion and I was pleased that a decent number of people attended! I felt like I wanted more of an outcome — probably out of a sense of responsibility for those attending the session. I got good feedback and as was pointed out to me later in the day, the discussion, the connections and the awareness are all positive outcomes. For my first unconference pitch I was reasonably pleased.During the morning breaks and at lunch I chatted with a few people, I bumped into Dawn from GDS on my way to the first session. Dawn has asked if I’ll present at a GDS Community of Interest event and collared me to reminded me that I hadn’t responded. I did an impromptu Churchill/Greyhound demo to someone, I spoke with Daniel about coming to visit us as he is based in Newcastle, met Cath who is lovely and had to make a couple of phone calls to Stuart (about nailing some finer details for Churchill private beta) and Corinne (about the meeting I’d missed, we discussed and agreed how to handle the scope questions and the risk by incorporating decision points into the 17/18 plans — a good outcome).I caught up with Jim (Delivery Director for the joint DWP/DH Work & Health Unit) after one of the sessions session for a quick chat about our work on developing products and how we dovetailed with the analytical community in the department.During the afternoon breaks I bumped into Ben (Head of User Centred Design in DWP) in the break whom I haven’t seen for ages. Ben is leaving DWP over the summer so it was nice to catch up.I’m on lookout the for an interaction designer. Ben had spoken to Paul (Director of Data and Analytics) in Leeds the day before and we spoke about resourcing in the context of 17/18 plans. Ben was complementary of the work in my team and what we have achieved within our context but recognised that we can take it to the next level with the right skills in the right places.I’d seen a few comments on Twitter throughout the day like the one from AmandaThe whole day and the final session in particular definitely illustrated the different personality types.Kit rounded off the day with a bit of a call to action and then people convened in the pub.I had a chat with Fiona and met some more ‘Twitter folk’ — I had a good chat with Paul (a front end developer in DWP) who had built the OneTeamGov website. We spoke about tools and stoicism -and then football. Paul is a Manchester United fan and I was reminded about this — boooooo.I spoke to Matt (Head of design at NHS Digital) about how things were going in his new role and the topic of MacBooks etc came up again. I met Richard and we spoke about #homelesshack.I thanked Kit and Lorena for their support on the day and spun past the hotel to drop my bag off and headed to Southwark to catch up with Alan. I’ve spoken previously about how supportive Alan has been and it was good to catch up. I met John (a data visualisation journalist), Chelsea (a social media journalist) and a few others. It was interesting being a random civil servant in a bar full of journalists. I’m a big fan of John’s work (and as it turns out Chelsea’s too). It was good to hear that John is a Newcastle United fan.FridayGovernment Statistical Service Presentation and Dissemination Symposium. I’ve outlined my thoughts/experiences of the event in the #daynotes here — although I only attended half of the event. Below is the stuff the happened in between.I packed my bags and headed to Victoria Street and collected my badge, it was lovely to see Tegwen (GSS Good Practice Team) and Neil (the departing Head of DWP Statistical Services) on the way in.The theme of the day was communication with impact, I’d been asked to talk about Churchill. I sat at the back with Matt, Rob and Catherine. I hadn’t seen Rob since the Graphical Web Conference in November, it was good to catch up briefly.After my session I chatted with Darren B (Open Data at ONS). We spoke about the challenges of ‘sorting out data’.I need to follow up with Darren.I also caught up with Hiren (from BEIS), Mark (a statto at DWP) and Mike who was my first ever boss in DWP. I haven’t seen Mike for ages so it was good to see him. I’d decided in the morning that I was going to leave the event at lunchtime to get back home at a reasonable time since I’d been away from all week so I hunted Rob down, who was with Darren W, to say goodbye before I dashed to the station.On the journey back I got a message from Catherine to say that DWP had won a presentation and dissemination award for our work on Churchill, Stat-Xplore, our interactive stats visualisation dashboards and gov.uk. A real cross team effort.I made it back home to see my daughters swimming training.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.tales from the internet of public service","ReflectionThis has been quite an unusual week for me.From a practical point of view I’ve had a couple of shorter days in the office. This was partly to try and balance out next week which will also be very unusual as I will have a full week in London.Overall my mood this week has been one of reflection.Part of my reflection has been about people. Mostly in a positive way.I am fascinated -and drawn to- personality type tests. I’ve read quite a bit about the subject, its history and the analytical shortcomings of some of the more popular tests. It feels like a guilty pleasure.In Myers-Briggs I have always been INTJ — a barn owl in this test. I recognise the good and the bad in the descriptions. As I’m sure do the team.MondayI was a little later into the office as I wanted to wave my son off on his school residential.I caught up with Stuart (data scientist product owner for Churchill) over a coffee. He was back from leave so I brought him up to speed with some of the top level things. This ran over so I dialled in slightly late to the fortnightly catch up call with Charlie and our Digital Engagement team colleagues about comms.Daniel (data scientist) sent over a couple of gifs I’d asked for ahead of my Civil Service Live talk. I double checked some of the details of the analysis behind what was represented. During this discussion we both realised that the feature -which identified local, regional, multi-regional and national phenomenon- could be adapted for re-use across products. (I don’t think either of us could believe we hadn’t picked up on this sooner!)I tested everything worked as expected. The background to the gifs rendered better in Safari than Chrome or Firefox, so I loaded everything in Safari and double checked some Mac keyboard shortcuts.I then sat with Daniel and Sree (data scientist) to set off a conversation about how Sree’s work on state based sequences and lead lag dynamics might link with what Daniel and I had just realised about the identification of geographical phenomenon. Then I left them to it.I had a quick call with Charlie (my boss) then phoned Dan H (a GDS data scientist) to arrange to meet the following day.I exchanged a few messages on data visualisation.I headed out the door later than I wanted but had time for a very quick Lync chat with Sarah (Head of Labour Market Evidence and Narrative) who updated me on some progress following our conversation last week.TuesdayCivil Service Live 2017 day. In my home town, Gateshead. I was presenting which meant unfortunately I missed the DWP Women in Digital event in Leeds — but I did get a nice shoutout.I started the day in a quiet coffee shop -always nice. Emails and a bit of prep, checking I had presentation timings right. Then met Stuart, walked to the venue, registered and joined the opening address from John Manzoni (Chief Executive of the Civil Service).I then met Dan H for a coffee. Dan and I had spoken a few times but this was the first time we’d met face to face. We had a good chat, for about an hour and a half, part of which was an informal interview for the GDS Digital people blog. I talked about my experiences in growing the hub, my philosophy for the team and establishing our identity. I was open and honest and whenever Dan wrote down quotes I wondered whether I had said something controversial!Stuart joined Dan and I for a bit -we chatted about culture change and attitude- before heading off to a plenary session on leadership. John Manzoni again and Clare Moriarty (Permanent Secretary for Defra) with their reflections and experiences of leadership during uncertainty.John talked about creating stretching roles, setting context and helping people. Claire covered how uncertainty can produce paralysis and so openness and honesty in communicating during these times is very important. She used a great analogy about leaders needing to move between the balcony view and the dance floor view to provide context for people. Stuart and I both commented on how good -and very honest- Claire’s talk was.Then it was time for my cameo. I met Sarah (from Cabinet Office) and Dan to set up for our session on data for better decision making, policy and delivery. We had a few last minute tech things to sort out as I was demo-ing from my own machine.Dan topped and tailed the session. He talked about the Government Data Science Partnership (GDSP) — made up of the Cabinet Office, the Government Office for Science (GO Science) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). He covered what data science is, where it is right now and where it is heading in Government. He finished with some information about the Data Science Accelerator Programme, communities and career paths and Data Literacy. I particularly liked this line…In between, I talked about setting up the hub in Newcastle, a bit about DWP Digital and multidisciplinary teams. I gave a demo of Churchill -explaining its importance in trailblazing the culture change and infrastructure development part- and a version of Greyhound and some of the other embedded analytics we have in the pipeline.The session seemed to go down well and generated a good variety of questions including around openness and ethics. A few people came up for a chat afterwards. There was interest in being involved in private beta for Churchill, I also pointed a couple of folk to the accelerator programme.Coincidentally, in the afternoon I bumped into Ian T (former DWP analyst, now at DEFRA). Ian is part of the next accelerator cohort who will be mentored in our hub, joining in a couple of weeks.I caught up for a chat Dawn (“data and policy nerd” at GDS) about the day and the city. We also spoke about a GDSP thing we are working on with Jane and Owen (from ONS).I got through a few emails, visited some of the Civil Service Live stalls and asked Kit for a favour before catching up with a friend for a drink on the quayside in the early evening sun.WednesdayWorking from home day. This started with lying with my daughter on her bed watching a storm out of the window. Thankfully this came to a sudden stop in time for me to walk her to school.I did some thinking about a couple of potential pitches -around data- for the OneTeamGov unconference. Perhaps subliminally prompted by the fact that Kit had been so great about the favour I’d asked the day before.I spent a lot of the day on emails and admin as I tend to do on Wednesdays. I had an early evening meeting at my son’s new secondary school -which meant I couldn’t travel to London that day for another meeting. Seeing his new form teacher made me feel very old.ThursdayA half day. I went into the office in the morning.I caught up with Alaine (our delivery lead) ahead of her well earned two weeks holiday. We spoke about funding, contracts, production environments, IT health check plus other private beta preparation activities. I then caught up with Stuart we discussed the various presentations we have to deliver next week.I had a discussion around the practical challenges of embedding analytics within our products.I left early to watch my son’s school cricket and spend the rest of the afternoon with him since he was back from his residential. I had another meeting at the new secondary school, this one about music.Later in the day I spoke to Charlie about monkeys and typewriters.FridayEmails then a catch up with Joana and Gayll about Greyhound ahead of some upcoming meetings they had lined up. I outlined my views on a few things and we separated out some of the challenges.I grabbed a coffee on my way into a Churchill design meeting with Stuart, Dave D (business analyst), Dave R and Massimo (developers) to discuss priorities for the next two sprints. I like these meetings, I can’t always get to them. We were all honest and pragmatic and eventually covered (almost) everything Dave D wanted us to in the two hours. I then had a phone call with Paul A.I sat with Michael who wanted to chat with me about a data visualisation design challenge he was facing. As it happened it was virtually identical to something Adam and I had tackled in detail relatively recently. I grabbed Adam, we talked Michael through a couple of solutions, shared some code and showed a similar example from Tom’s statistics team’s work. A perfect example of our data vis design community in action.Adam then talked me through progress with the data visualisation awareness material — its looking really good.I had a really positive call with Gayll and Iu to discuss modelling with encrypted data and then joined the weekly Lync session between the team and Charlie.I walked out the office at about half five which, since I went to the right pool this week, meant I got to see my daughter’s swimming trainingThat was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.tales from the internet of public service","PrideI complained last week of having very little thinking time. I had a little more this week, I include some aspects of that below.My overall feeling at the end of this week was pride. I’m immensely proud of our team, individually and collectively. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved in the relatively short time we’ve been together especially given some of the wider context which I won’t bore people with.Some time ago I toyed with the GTD productivity/time management method. Part of this involves working from a regularly empty inbox. I still use some of the principles but I have rarely been near inbox zero. Recently -for reasons I can’t quite establish- I decided to aim for that target as I was convinced it would somehow ‘make me feel better’. I failed big time this week.Monday morning was emailsDave R popped up to talk about the new UI features he’s prototyping for Churchill. I explained my related thoughts on the how the Statistical Services dashboard products should/could/will fit within our developing family of applications and how users should be able to move between exploratory and explanatory aspects seamlessly.Then I Lynced into the regular Data and Analytics Directorate Grade 6 forum. We covered, amongst other things feedback from the site ‘stand ups’ -which I mentioned last week- and a discussion about a leadership initiative we are rolling out across the directorate.After the call I caught up with Dave D about more feedback from Churchill users. I asked a few questions about where we were with the current sprint ahead of Tuesday’s mid-sprint session and a gave Dave my high level thoughts on some aspects of scope, scheduling and prioritisation for the next couple of sprints relating to our move to private beta.I popped for a chat about arrangements for the Next Tech Girls initiative in Newcastle and later had an interesting call which Kate (from the Data and Analytics Gateway team) chaired, about some potential discovery work — hopefully more to come on this.I spoke with Becky about an upcoming board meeting where trialling Manhattan would be discussed and we needed to supply some documentation. We had a few outstanding questions which meant I needed to try and catch Kevin H (who is responsible for security and operational control within Data and Analytics) for a chat about data and role based access. Coincidentally Kev appeared at my desk and asked if I’d pop into a meeting he was in to give a short demo. I didn’t get to ask my questions though.The impromptu presentation meant I left the office a lot later than intended. On the commute home I was pleased to see the tweet below. The short video features Becky, Joana and Daniel from the team. I loved what they -and of course the others in the video- had to say.TuesdayFelt like telephone day, I was pleased to have a headset.I popped to Sree’s desk when I arrived as she wanted a chat about the ideas we’d discussed on Friday around state based sequences and the research papers I’d shared. It was a good chat. Sree talked through her initial ideas and I gave my views on which data to use initially.I’m really excited about this piece of work. Its part of a theme of activity to develop some fantastically reusable embedded analytics pipelines for our applications. The particular area that Sree is investigating is one that I’ve thought about a lot and been keen to explore for a very, very long time.This stuff could be incredibly powerful.Joana joined the conversation when she arrived in the office and we discussed how Sree’s work could bridge a few other pieces of work, including the aspects of Greyhound which Joana is working on. Then I collared Kevin and he came and sat with Becky and I for five minutes to answer our questions. This meant we could get the board meeting papers ready. We’re treading new ground with a lot of our work so we’re very careful to ensure we’re well informed on the data protection, security and legal aspects of what we do. In that way we can be confident to innovate appropriately. Becky has been incredible.I met with Alaine and Ash (who is amazing and runs the software development team in Data and Analytics) ahead of a -potentially very long- call about Directorate level planning for the remainder of 17/18. Alaine had been in Sheffield the day before supporting the planning and needed a couple of things from Ash. I’d hoped that this, plus the prep we all did last week, would pretty much finalise our part of the plans. Which in turn would mean I wouldn’t be needed for all of the planning call.Ahead of the call I grabbed five minutes with Daniel to plant an idea in his head for embedded analytics to automatically identify certain features in Churchill .I joined the planning call for a short while but had to dip out to call Dawn about the Government Data Science Partnership Civil Service Live Session at Sage Gateshead on Tuesday June 20. Dawn had asked me last week if I’d make a guest speaker cameo covering the work of our Hub. So we had a chat about the details. We also spoke about the data literacy strand of work within GDS which sounds really good.I rejoined the planning call and then we all took a break to dial into an all staff call for DWP Digital with Mayank.Alaine informed me I didn’t need to dial into the remainder of the planning call -result- so I reviewed the board meeting papers that Becky had pulled together and then caught up with Alaine to discuss the planning meeting actions -me to speak to David B (from our data architecture team) about platforms and architecture- so we set up a call for the following day.Since I’d left late the day before I decided to use the commute home to dial into another all staff call this time for the whole of DWP. That made it around four hours on the phone during the day which is very unusual and not altogether pleasant.I made it back in time to walk my son home from school and have a coffee with my Mam before we collected my daughter from after school football.WednesdayWorking from home day. Quite a bit of admin, logistics and emails in the morning, during which I (finally) saw Lisa’s Open Vis Conference talk which talks about empathy vs rationality in data visualisation. It’s very, very good and made me think more about the human side of the data in our products.Charlie called for our rearranged fortnightly catch up. We mainly talked about Churchill private beta and the 17/18 planning work. Then we both dialled into the weekly prioritisation call with the others hubs. Its always good to hear what everyone else is getting up to.In the afternoon I started some prep for the Civil Service Live talk including a chat with Daniel about some gifs he’d previously produced. I messaged Steve A (who is a developer in Ash’s team) to arrange to get a physical build of Churchill on my MacBook for me to demo on the day. I responded to a few emails and set up a few chats for later in the week.In between all that I had a call with David B, Paul G (agile delivery manager), Alaine and Ash about architecture and platforms in relation to 17/18 plans. A positive meeting which untangled a few things and clarified what is for now and what is for later.I headed off to collect my son from school, we went for a walk. I bought some Jelly Tots. I had a quick exchange with Stephen about AWS Virtual Private clouds and networking virtual servers (Stephen has promised to educate me further, he has a remarkable talent for explanation) then collected my daughter from after school guitar lessons.ThursdayI had a very full calendar. I grabbed a chat with Joana first thing about Greyhound, local economy data and models and then a quick conversation with Becky about the board meeting papers for Manhattan.My first scheduled meeting was the regular catch up with Alaine. I have different types of meetings with different people in the team. I have asked people what they prefer — for example Stuart (product owner for Churchill) and I tend to have short walking meetings as and when we need to talk. Alaine’s preference is a regular meeting in the calendar. I haven’t got it quite right on team comms yet but hoping my #weeknotes will help with that a little.I grabbed a coffee and we talked a bit about the past week or so, covered some staffing stuff and looked ahead to the next quarter and rest of the year both in team terms and personal/career development. It was a good chat.I had another quick chat with Daniel about gifs and he sent me a version of Greyhound to load onto my MacBook for Civil Service Live. Then it was straight into a call with Sarah (Head of Labour Market Evidence and Narrative) about possible links between two areas of our work. It was an informative conversation.I was slightly late for the meeting/call with Adam, Stephen, Mark and Paul to feedback on the current version of the data visualisation material. I hadn’t devoted as much time to reviewing it as I’d wanted to but we made good progress and there were some good challenges to ideas.Then it was a cross-Digital call about DWP Digital practices, job families and roles which meant Corinne (Head of Data and Analytics Live Services) and I couldn’t have our regular call. Before I left I managed to read and sign off the final version of our contribution to the 17/18 plan.FridayI popped downstairs to give my MacBook to Alastair (one of the developers working on Churchill) to put the local build on it and then caught up with Michael (UI developer) about a few things. I always have good conversations with Michael, I think I’ve converted him in terms of how he looks at data visualisation design and he has introduced me to important user experience concepts.I tried to structure some of my thoughts for Civil Service Live and then joined a Lync session with James (part of the Digital Transformation Team in the DWP Operational Control Centre) to show him Greyhound. This was set up following Kit’s workshop a couple of weeks back. During the lunch break of the workshop I showed the application to Deborah (Head of Universal Credit Digital Transformation) and Jackie (who manages Digital Transformation in the Operational Control Centre). Jackie saw potential uses in her area and set up the meeting with James.It was a really positive call. James was very complementary of Greyhound and the ‘strategic lens’ is offers. He gave us some background of his area and we agreed to follow up with a visit.Pleasingly, a big theme of the conversation on both sides was about the importance of context. At a high level my questions to James were -if you had all the data you’re asking for, what would you do with it?I popped down to chat with Dave R about the prototype Churchill UI features.Dave R is never going to design an invisible interface to data but together we’re trying to make sure the data is the star of the show. The challenge is how to iterate to where we want to be without disrupting the experience along the way. Dave R is really patient with me and often has an idea waiting before I’ve asked the question.Alastair dropped my MacBook back to me which meant I could do a little more preparation for Civil Service Live including a quick chat with Daniel to discuss the material he was supplying and to borrow some cables and adapters from him and test a few things -live demos are probably more informative than slides but do carry more risk!I joined the weekly Greyhound/Manhattan Lync session with Charlie. Then since I had no chance of making inbox zero, I got down to inbox 100 before heading to my daughters swimming training.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.tales from the internet of public service","FrustrationFirst time writing week notes. Inspired by Matt and Dan (whose format I have shamelessly adopted here). Thought I’d give it a go.At the very least writing this stuff down was useful to me.I covered who me is in Matt’s What is it you actually do? I lead the Data Science Hub for the Department for Work and Pensions in Newcastle. Effectively an R&D function in Digital, Data and Analytics. We design, prototype and pilot data-driven and embedded-analytics products. This is to support, inform and transform strategy, policy and operations.For context and reference, since this is my first #weeknotes I’ve included more detail than I would normally intend to.This week felt like a lot of meetings, emails and planning activity which left me little thinking time. So my overall feeling at the end of the week was frustration. Although in writing this stuff down I probably covered more of what I like — working with the team on the detail — than it felt.I was on leave for half term and came into the office on Monday morning, after a Sunday evening email skim read and triage, with a plan and a list of half a dozen tasks I wanted to complete that day.After a quick catch up with a few people I ticked number one off the list. I sent out an article “Hands up if you don’t like data!” to the area of the department responsible for current and future policy.The article was comms about Churchill one of our products which I’ve blogged about here. The ultra high level user story isI then caught up with Dave D (our business analyst) to discuss the Churchill user engagement and feedback that had taken place while I was on leave.Some Monday meetings had parachuted into my calendar while I was on leave. The first was a late morning call with Max (program manager for Data Science) which blew my plan and list out of the water. Max called about the work of my team for 17/18. This year is focused on scaling.In practice this means working with Data Engineering colleagues to continue to develop our cloud based platform, design standards, APIs/Microservices and analytics that underpin — and are embedded into — our Data Science products and are enablers for future products. It also means focusing on creating families of applications that work together and appreciate the context of the users so they can move between them seamlessly.The outcome of that call meant providing some more detail on deliverables, resources, indicative costs and such like for the rest of the year to take to a meeting on Thursday — which had a pre-meeting call on Wednesday — lovely. I arranged to sit with Alaine (our delivery lead) the next day to pull it all together.I had a couple of other chats/meetings, around piloting two of our other applications.One, Manhattan, is our data application for Employer Engagement Advisors. This was a chat with Becky (a statistician in our team and product owner for Manhattan) about the underlying data and role based access. The second, Greyhound, is an embedded analytics application for Work Services Directorate. This was an update on our side and a discussion about next steps.Towards the end of the day I had a call with Adam, Stephen and Paul. We’re trying something new with data visualisation awareness. I’ve written a few sessions over the last few years and they have evolved significantly in terms of audience, purpose and delivery method as demand broadened out beyond analysts and digital folk.With this iteration our focus is on getting people to think about data visualisation in terms of communication, providing some examples and resources to support thinking.We’re designing the material to be self-lead learning via the web and considering making it open. The outcome of the meeting was for myself and Stephen to review the current version and feedback by next Thursday.Monday night was the league AGM for my son’s football team which I coach. They have updated their website, are looking to reduce paper forms and are reusing information they already hold on players. Nice.TuesdayBack to back meetings day, bleurgh.I was running a little late so once I got in the office before I logged on I popped for a chat with Paula (Head of the Data and Analytics Private Office). Each site holds monthly Directorate level ‘stand ups’ lead by a Grade 6. It was Paula’s turn in the afternoon. These meetings are a chance for us to give some updates and to get some feedback from folks in Newcastle. Paula and I generally support each other in the prep and compare notes ahead of them.Then I was straight into chat about supporting Statistical Services colleagues with some learning and development objectives. I’m working with them as part of developing our family of applications so it made sense to align things. I’m a fan of joint, self-lead learning so I outlined some ideas and fired off an email to a about “L&D partnerships with a purpose” which prompted a great reaction from Kit.Next up the weekly Data Science prioritisation call. Charlie (my boss and Head of DWP Data Science) leads a catch up with hubs in Newcastle, London and Sheffield plus the programme team.Then Alaine and I started pulling together the information needed for Thursday’s Directorate level meeting. Most of this information already existed in some form and just needed some structure and refinement. It was a long meeting and involved lots of coffee on my part. Alaine was great.The stand up meeting with Paula didn’t last as long as scheduled which gave me some time back.I got a chat in with Dave R, a developer working on prototyping some new UI aspects of Churchill. I really liked what he’d done. I spoke to Daniel (a Data Scientist in our team). We discussed the challenge of visualising 150 million records down to fine detail to examine cyclical daily/weekly/annual peaks and troughs ahead of some further analysis. I suggested — both for their space saving and heat map type properties — using multi panel horizon charts.Charlie phoned me. We digressed and I spoke a bit about some of this— in a positive way. They all apply but number 6 is very important to me.Before I left I chatted to Gayll, who oversees Greyhound and Manhattan. We looked ahead to some more cross Government collaboration, working with academia and exploring modelling with encrypted data. We talked specifics about supporting the next round of Data Science Accelerator folk in our hub.After work I went to watch my 8 year old daughter training at her swimming club.WednesdayI work from home on Wednesdays so I can walk the kids to and from school.Wednesday morning was reviewing the documents Alaine had pulled together which meant I missed our cross Data Science Information session from the London Hub.Then I blitzed all the emails that I would class as “not immediate replies” — so where I need to check or gather some information or think about the detail of the response a little. I tend to bundle these up and reply to them all in one session, usually on a Wednesday when I’m at home.This week included emails about working with Next Tech Girls in Newcastle. The initiative’s aim is to sustainably and strategically increasing the number of women in technology by securing meaningful work experience for girls. I am co-ordinating with Lou (our HR business partner) and Marie-Clare from the initiative to set something up in Newcastle as the expand from London. I also had requests to talk/present/pitch at various things this month, Government Data Publishers Community, Civil Service Live, One Team Government and the snappily titled Government Statistical Services Presentation and Dissemination symposium.After the call about Thursdays meeting I collected my son early from school for a doctors appointment then walked my daughter to Brownies.ThursdaySheffield. Directorate level planning day. In a hot room all day going through a variety of programmes and projects for 17/18.At the station on the journey home I bumped into Tony who used to work in the Sheffield Hub. It was good to catch up. It made me reflect on the amount we’ve achieved in a relatively short space of time.Emails on the train and I also got round to reading the super astute What a digital organisation looks like from Janet Hughes, have a read.I’d aimed to head straight from the station to catch the end of my daughters swimming training but ended up going to the wrong pool. Fool.I went to vote. I went with my son. We chatted about politics, policies, politicians and the media. Which was unexpected.FridayI was a little late into the office as I walked the kids to school. I had a pretty free calendar, which I always aim for on a Friday.I caught up with Sree (Data Scientist in our team) to chat through some R&D ideas related to Manhattan and Greyhound.We’ve used a little Companies House data and I’d come across this which was a nice and relevant use of the data. The bulk of the chat was about some work to examine state based sequences and lead lag dynamics, I shared a couple of research papers.I dialled into our fortnightly catch up call with the Digital Engagement team about comms. I like this meeting, comms people are a different breed, in a good way.Our team behind Churchill have been shortlisted for Digital Team of the year in the upcoming Computing Digital Technology Leaders Awards for their work on design, development and delivery.The team are up against some big names and established companies from the world of Digital Marketing, Cyber Security, Social Housing, Healthcare and academia. It’s an honour to be recognised alongside different sectors.I took a look at Dave R’s next prototype iteration which he’d sent me the day before and did some admin before heading home.That was my week.Clapping shows how much you appreciated Ryan Dunn’s story.Data Science Hub Lead @DWPDigital. These are my personal thoughts on my work week.tales from the internet of public service"
